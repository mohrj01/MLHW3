The hotel has been changed we hardly recognize it. New design of guest rooms, new Italian restaurant /it used to be Mexican in the past/ with a good quality cuisine and wines.

Only remark is that the hospitality tray was a little lacking. Only 2 sachets of coffee and 2 tea bags. I would recommend taking a few sachets and tea bags with you, but its not a complaint, just a remark. The breakfast was superb, so much to choose from, you really couldn't fail to fill up before a long day sightseeing. I would highly recommend this hotel,","December 31, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

The Hotel & room's are very clean and the food was fabulous & drinks both very reasonably priced we ate there every night after a long day in the city, the trams stop's outside the hotel so it was easy to get to the main square number 6 tram 7 stop's same back too.

23,"Have just returned from a fantastic weekend in Prague. 9 of us stayed in the Plaza Alta hotel. The location is perfect for exploring the city. The hotel is located across from a tram stop that will take you to Old Town Square or the castle in around 10 minutes. Rooms are clean, spacious and well equipped. Breakfast is served in the restaurant attached and offers a wide variety of cooked foods, pastries etc. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely return to Prague and use this hotel as our base! ","December 16, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

24,"Party of 9 just returned from a 3 night stay at this immaculate, brilliantly placed hotel & it was so, so close to being 100% perfect. Lets get them out of the way - 2 small gripes - the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in standard rooms & slightly draughty/noisy windows - BUT, even these cant tarnish our view of this hotel which we would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. Just a short walk to the underground metro station or the tram stop - we got around the city easily with 7 children, hoping on & off their fantastic public transport with tickets available at the corner shop opposite the tram stop. (Any tram takes you one stop to the underground metro c line ‘nadrai holesovic’ station) The 3 rooms we had were all modern, comfortable, spacious and very, very clean. Rooms were cleaned daily & fresh towels provided where required.The included breakfast was served in the 7 tacos restaurant accessible through reception and its was superb. Frequently restocked, buffet style, it included continental, full english, pancakes, a selection of fresh fruit & breads with teas, coffee and a selection of fruit juices. All very relaxed, we were never rushed but the staff were attentive and friendly. The location is the real bonus - approx 10 mins from the very centre of town in a residential area, which means you’ll pay more local prices in the surrounding restaurants & bars, rather than the capital city prices you find in town. We never paid more than £9 per person for a meal including 2 drinks in local restaurants. We used 3 of the local restaurants, all less than 5 mins walk - the adjacent Chinese, classic Czech cuisine at Zlata Kovadlina & the imposing but amazingly cool Cross Club. Great food, great beer, great prices. ","November 29, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

25,"My first impression was not excellent tbh because of it’s dated green Color facade, the small reception desk, the dark coloured carpet and the antique looking furniture in the room. BUT these were all changed on my 2nd night. I looked into the details; impeccably clean grout lines, clean siliconed areas, no cracks on wall, toilet marble top, no peeling of furniture, wall paper. This hotel is actually in really good shape. To maintain this level of upkeep throughout the years, it’s not easy yet plaza Alta does it really well. Breakfast was simple fare, not alot of variety BUT I had the best croissant (not even in Vienna) and honey from their spread. One other good thing is this newly opened restaurant, 1min walk from hotel called The Eatery, they have the best garlic soup and deep fried celery I ever had. Total 4 fab nights stay, thank you plaza Alta.","November 27, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

We did not eat but those who did said it was bland and very small portions.Room nice , sixth floor, clean, free safe, but tram noise could be heard until 2am and started again at 6am.

30,I stayed for 5 nights at the plaza Alta hotel . Rooms were clean but small . Towels and rooms cleaned daily . Dressing gown and slippers in room which was a bonus . Great WiFi . Breakfast was ok self service buffet . Only downside was I asked for a breakfast teabag one evening as there were none in the room and I never got it. Which was pretty annoying . The tram stop outside was great a number 6 takes you directly into town . If u buy a day ticket you can travel about once in town on any tram for 24 hours . Also a bonus the trams run 24 /7 . ,"October 22, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

31,"The hotel itself is good, breakfast was a real plus. Room spacious and clean, however the double glazing didn't keep the noise at bay, every vehicle & tram could be heard pretty much thru the night. Staff very helpful, very pleasant. There's a nice little Chinese restaurant 25m away where the food is good, only real issue was that the lass had a young child that took her attention (we don't eat late). My main issue with the hotel was their evening meal, either they can't tell the difference between pork & beef or they were just trying to offload pork. The food was good but rather than make a point I let it go - don't trust kitchen staff when they are criticised if you get my drift, take it on the chin and move on.","October 11, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

The room was a standard, but it was very big and also included a mini bar. I loved that everyone who worked there was so friendly, seemed happy and very eager to help us. The rooms were cleaned everyday on time and if ever we were in and needed the room cleaned later that was no problem. all information needed was always given to us if needed and the hotel is only maybe 15 minutes away from the centre of the city centre. the tram is right outside of the hotel and everything is so easy because of this. bikes are available at the hotel to ride and tours are also available. overall the experience there was perfect and I will be booking with them again on my next trip to Prague.ps: being an English speaker I had no troubles communicating. pss: I never heard any other persons living there. it was so quiet!","September 25, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

33,"We travelled with our 8 year old from England. The hotel is in a great location, short journey by tram number 6 (kids love the trams!) to the city centre. Even getting to and from airport so easy. From airport take the regular bus down to the underground station and Praha Holesovice is the nearest underground to the hotel. It is 8 minutes walk to the hotel or take the tram.The room was spacious enough and comfortable for 3, nice bathroom, quiet hotel, reception staff was very helpful, friendly and courteous. Also it was very hot outside (30 degrees) and air-conditioning was important and worked.  Breakfast was amazing, full English as well as Czech and freshly baked breads, Czech cakes, croissants. Choices of teas and coffees. It really was more like a Breakfast-Lunch. Also you have a little shops around if you want to buy ""picnic"" for your trip around Prague.Tip: if you travel with children: As you walk across Charles Bridge towards The Castle, before you exit on your right hand side is a little children playground, a real gem for kids to rest (next to Kampa restaurant)We enjoyed the hotel so much, that will not be looking for anything else as we will be back.","September 23, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

41,"My husband and I did a land tour and one of the hotels we stayed in was Plaza Alto Hotel in Prague. I requested a shower and traded with the coach driver with the approval of the desk clerk. Our room was sub standard. Night table next to bed was missing. We went to the desk. As I approached the desk, the women desk clerk looked at me and said ""you are the women who had to have a shower"" in a loud and nasty voice. Then the male clerk started shouting in a loud and nasty voice ""you got a shower what more do you want""? I asked nicely if I could have a night table for my side of the bed. You could see that at one time there was a table from the indentations in the carpet. The male desk clerk kept yelling. I told him this is no was to treat guests. As I walked away the female clerk yelled ""you can't have a table from the lobby"". We have traveled for many years and have stayed in many hotels and have never been treated like this. It has never occurred to me to ask for a lobby table or receive one. I did not tell them that our TV did not work or the toilet seat was falling off. I waited for the night clerk to come on duty and told him about the toilet seat. He said someone would be there in the morning to fix it. It was never fixed and we were there for 2 days. In the morning our coach group and other guests were having breakfast in the dining room. When one of our fellow tour guests asked the busboy if he would clean off a table since there was no other place to sit. His response was to yell""OK, OK, OK"". This was disruptive to the other guests trying to eat their breakfast. These people need a course in How To Treat Hotel Guests. We do not recommend this hotel to anyone and we will never stay there again.","May 22, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

43,Stayed here for three nights as part of a short break at the end of April 2018. We had the only room which had a balcony which overlooked the front of the hotel. The room was lovely and big with a separate toilet and bathroom. There were tea facilities available in the room.There was a small fitness room on the first floor and breakfast was provided as part of the deal. The staff were very helpful in terms of advice about trams and trains which passed near to the hotel. There were limited restaurants in the area but food and drinks were very reasonably priced. Really enjoyed the experience but then we did have very good weather.,"April 25, 2018","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

45,"My partner and I spent a weekend at the Plaza Alta and I have to say it is a lovely hotel. Jan who works at reception is very friendly and very helpful and knowledgable about the area. He is a big asset to the hotel. The breakfast was lovely bacon, eggs, sausage, croissants, ham, cheese toast. The coffee although from a machine was very nice. Selection of hot and cold food. The room 212 was comfortable, clean and the location is very quiet enabling you to sleep. Overall a lovely stay I would definitely recommend and stay there again. The only issue I would point out and this is nothing to do with the hotel but there are some unscrupulous taxis in the city centre who charge you a ridiculous fee of 500 korunas to bring you a short distance journey from the city centre to the hotel. Please be careful regarding this and use the tram if you can, or speak to Jan to arrange a taxi. Prague is a beautiful city and the Plaza Alta hotel is great.

At the very least, the reception offers stamps, postal services, tickets for the zoo, tickets for public transport (30 minutes and 3 days only) and a cute, glass duck that supports the local zoo.The hotel is really close to public transport, which is a boon for anyone who wants to visit the city, but not get a hotel in the city proper.Trams 6 and 12 stop within 200 meters of the hotel and you can get tickets at the stop or even at the hotel.We didn't use the access to the fitness, though.","November 5, 2017","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

50,This was one of the host hotels for a key international sports event outside Prague. Everything OK. Nothing exceptional. Clean. Twin beds. TV limited.

51,"We stayed 3 nights. To my surprise the hotel has 4 stars, well in my opinion it is more like 3 star hotel. The hotel is situated few tram stops from old town. Public transport is near and it made very easy to go around the town. This is the most positive thing about the hotel. The room was clean but quite small, one of the sheets in bed had a hole in it. The pillows needs to be changed also. Unfortunately we got room on the 1st floor, right above the service entrance and every morning I woke up at 6 AM due to the loud noise coming from the service coridor. All the laundry and carbage containers made terrible noise while dragged on the floor early morning. This was quite annoying. As it was very warm outside I wanted to keep the window open during the night, but it wasn't possible due to the noise. The room had conditioner, but I don't like to use it much. Even with the window closed the noise was terrible. One evening we decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant. There was some issues with electricity and we waited the food at least 1,5 hours. We wasn't informed in any way that the kitchen had problems, just waited and waited. Breakfast was the same every morning. Not bad, but nothing extra good either. Some negative experiences unfortunately and I probably will not book this hotel again.","August 14, 2017","0    Plaza Prague Hotel

54,"How lucky was I to stay at this cool, hip hotel on a very quiet street, away from the crowds, but only a 5 minute walk to Old Town. My upgraded room was huge and oh so chic. The staff were always helpful and gracious. They assisted me with directions and suggestions and would investigate to get any information I needed. Prague's major sights are within walking distance or a short uber ride away, including the Jewish Quarter, Charles Bridge, Mala Strana and Castle hill. Dlouha street with it's amazing restaurants and food shops is also a 5 minute walk. You must try tiny Sister's Bistro, Michelin quality open face sandwiches and pastries with take-out prices, Nase Maso with delectable sausages, sandwiches, housemade charcuterie & steaks, cooked to order and Lokal, a charming beer hall with delish, traditional Czech dishes. I rarely eat breakfast in the hotel, but did so on my first morning and it was yummy with an enticing selection of both cold and hot dishes.. The prices for all this quality is extremely reasonable. Hope to stay again! One last tip if you love to eat as well as take in the history and current culture of Prague is to take a dinner tour with Prague Food Tour. Our guide and owner, Leona, took us to restaurants showcasing both traditional and new Czech food and was was a fascinating guide to the city. She gave me additional tips on Czech restaurants and sights away from the tourist hubs that immersed me in Prague's culture.

64,"Recently stayed here for 4 nights in June and can honestly say this hotel does not fail to impress. On arrival we were greeted with a lovely welcome drink in a gorgeous setting, we chose to get the bus and metro to the centre which is in easy walking distance to the hotel. We were shown to our room even though we were earlier than 3pm check in which was an added bonus. The lovely lady explained the room to us. The cleanliness and overall style of the view was worth every penny. In the library downstairs they offer free pastries and coffee through the day that you can help yourself too. The breakfast was also lovely with a variety of cold options (overnight oats, chia seed and mango, yogurts, fresh fruit, avocado, sweet pies, muffins, sandwiches, breads, meat, cheese etc, as well as a selection of hot food that they make to order. They also have sandwiches wrapped up in cling film which is ideal if you are going on a trip for the day and want to take one with you, we also did this on our return journey to the airport as we were not sure of options available. At 5-6pm every night the hotel also offers you a glass of wine complimentary and crips, we were also greeted with mini brownies on our first night in the room. They really do spoil you and make your stay extra special. They also provide you with a large bottle of water every day in your room which is lovely.In terms of location it is honestly ideal, within 10 minutes you are in the old jewish quarter, or Charles Bridge, we only got the metro once to the television tower as this was a few districts away but everything else is in walking distance from the hotel.

68,"BoHo is a small (50 rooms) boutique hotel in the centre of Prague. It has spacious modern rooms with well equipped bathrooms and quality furniture and fittings.The spa area, jacuzzi, steam and sauna looked very modern too. The fitness room is fairly limited but has four aerobic machines and mats for stretching. The addition of dumbbells, medicine balls and a clock would be very useful.I did not have time for breakfast (£18) but the breakfast room looks very attractive, bright and airy. Food wise, I only had a burger at the bar but it was super delicious and exactly how a burger should be (pic attached).All in all, BoHo is highly recommended although it is not for those on a budget with rooms averaging at around €200/night.TIPS: It, better to book direct, there seems to be a bigger difference than usual in price (lower) when doing so.Coffee and croissants are provided free in the library from 10:30 a.m. so if you miss breakfast you won’t starve.If you found this review helpful please give me a helpful vote, thank you.","May 17, 2019","1    BoHo Prague Hotel

The hotel is close to the metro and main railway station but i would recommend getting a taxi from the airport, it is a lot easier and reasonably cheap. The hotel is very modern with a welcoming reception area and bar. The hotel has a library which is cosy and serves complimentary pastries and coffee throughout the day, a wonderful gesture. There is also complimentary wine between six and seven every evening in the library, we were enjoying the bar experience so much we forgot to go. Breakfast is very good,with a large selection of buffet items and some hot specially cooked items. The rooms are absolutely wonderful , clean and spacious. We had a tub as well as a walk in shower and we felt like a king and queen. All of the staff are helpful and friendly and they were great tour guides.

72,"It’s been quite a while since we stayed at the BoHo Prague. However, my fond memories of the hotel warrants a review. The BoHo is a little oasis in a side street just off the bustling heart of scenic Prague. The tasteful décor, both in the lobby and rooms, provides a calming atmosphere. The room offers ample packing space, and our bathroom, with bath and shower, was spacious. I quite like its different design of smoky glass walls; when it's steamed up and the curtain drawn, enough privacy is provided. Unfortunately, there was no time for a leisurely bath while staying there, but the complimentary bath salt’s scent is heavenly – I would buy a bottle if I could! I don’t want to spoil all the special unexpected surprises but suffice to say there are many which guarantee an extraordinary stay. Our highlight was definitely the free walking tour with the lovely Gabriela Gogová. I ordered room service once and portion size is generous. We also decided to dine at the hotel’s restaurant before heading off to Municipal House; dinner was just lovely. Breakfast is generous and beautifully served.

As soon we arrived a member of staff immediately came outside to take our luggage. We then checked in and were offered a welcome drink of Prosecco which we had in the lovely bar area before being shown to our room. The room itself had a lovely big super king sized bed and was very modern and spotless. The bathroom was also lovely with little extras like slippers, a dressing gown and some lovely toiletries. The only issue we had is the lack of privacy in the bathroom as the walls were all glass, including the area where the toilet was. This is a matter of personal taste but for us it was a little bit odd. It could do with a thicker curtain perhaps. Other than that we had no complaints at all about this hotel. Amazing service - all the staff were lovely and extremely helpful which made our stay an absolute pleasure. The extra little touches like the complimetary wine tasting in the evening and complimentary danish pastries and coffee in the library were much appreciated. We didn't try the spa area but it looked lovely. The breakfast was also very good with plenty of choice with proper freshly squeezed orange juice.

The hotel is in a very quiet street but only 5 minutes walk to the old town (ladies don't wear heels as there are lots of cobbles). We had a superior room which was large and had everything we needed (enough hangers, mirrors, magnified mirror). The beds were large and comfortable and we both slept very well. The shower was powerful (a bugbear of mine is a powerless shower!) and there was enough light in the bathroom to put make up on! The breakfast was delicious. I loved the fact that a carafe of orange juice was placed on your table and the coffee was perfect (so many hotels have bland, weak coffee). The steam room and sauna, fitness room and plunge pool were well maintained and clean and quiet (we had the whole place to ourselves most of the time). I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Prague. PS - Visit the Museum of Communism - it is much more interesting than it sounds and gives a great insight into the recent history of Prague both moving and inspirational.","April 17, 2019","1    BoHo Prague Hotel

80,"This hotel is absolutely lovely. We ended up leaving a different hotel that was very uncomfortable and checking into Boho. I was thrilled! I was greeted with a complimentary glass of wine and taken on a tour. In my room there were little brownies waiting for me. The service was fantastic and the hotel itself was just what I was hoping for. The only thing I will mention is the bathroom in the room is very modern. It's beautiful but does not offer much privacy. This was no problem for me as I was with my husband, but could be a little uncomfortable for a different situation.","April 7, 2019","1    BoHo Prague Hotel

81,"Everything from the moment I got there was a pleasant surprise. Probably one of the best hotels I’ve stayed, great value for the price. The location is the best possible, the room was very clean and comfortable, the staff really helpful and kind except for one very rude man at the bar - I stayed for a week and he was rude to every guest I’ve seen him talking to. That mans rudeness managed to ruin dinner some of the nights I decided not to go out. Breakfast was probably the best I’ve had in hotels- not huge but had many different options even for people with food restrictions. SPA and sauna were pleasant, but a bit small so it got crowded sometimes. The only downside is the gym - pretty much just a treadmill and a bike, can’t do much in there.

84,"THe Boho Hotel in Prague is a great little hotel. It has all the good service and attention to detail of a 5 star hotel, very pleasant and attentive staff, and a lovely ambience - but with only 50 rooms. The interior is modern with a neutral palate that means it is timeless - and it was perfectly presented as if it had just opened. The rooms are very spacious and well presented. The breakfast was very good and the bar has a nice atmosphere. One very nice touch is the complimentary wine served between 6-7pm each night in the library which was like an adult social room. Just a few minutes from one of the gateways to central Prague it is in a great location. ","March 25, 2019","1    BoHo Prague Hotel

The city center, Charles Bridge, and many other cool places. We had the car parked at the valet when we arrived and never needed it until our departure. The car was not parked at the property, I don't believe they have a parking garage, however, they have an agreement with a nearby Marriott, and park it at the secure parking there. The rooms were very clean, modern with some traditional touches (think: Restoration Hardware). Simply BEAUTIFUL! Bathrooms were spotless, robes soft and towel fluffy.

102,"The Hotel staff make you feel very welcome with an offer of a lovely drink on arrival and check in. The lobby and bar area itself is very stylish, all dark and sultry with comfortable velvet sofas and upholstery. The restaurant, also stylish is completely different, light and bright with a Scandinavian feel to it. The staff also offer guests a free glass of wine and nibbles (pretzels) between 5-6pm before dinner, regardless of whether you are eating in the restaurant that night or not. This feels very nice, as does the library with open fire, lovely coffee table books to browse through and coffee available throughout the day/evening whenever you fancy.Breakfast is delicious and there is a huge choice. The bar is elegant if a bit empty. I was given a glass of corked wine and when I queried it the barman said it was fine. Needless to say, we then went out! It's in a great location near the Christmas markets and central square so you really do not have to go far to enjoy the beautiful streets and architecture. There are some nice places to eat nearby.We appreciated the Spa facilities in the Hotel, and the décor in the bedroom and bathroom is fun. Personally, I don't like looking at my clothes hanging and seeing my boots or shoes on the floor when I'm in bed, as it feels like I'm sleeping in a shop, but the smoky glass is pretty. The bathroom was very spacious, warm and bright. We didn't take a bath but it looked inviting. The shower cubical is large, but the hand shower unfortunately is positioned directly at the gap in the shower doors so the bathroom floor beyond gets a bit wet unless you use the overhead shower or angle the shower attachment so you are standing very close to the wall which is a bit awkward.Overall I would definitely recommend.

They had decorated the whole room for us with a champagne bottle. all 4 days of our stay we had them constantly asking us what else could they do for us to make our stay more pleasant.the hotel bar, old fashioned with great cocktails. throughly enjoyed it. we got some bar credit during our stay which was nicely utilised at the bar.highly recommended, walking distance to all prime locations of the city, the station, old town, charles bridge and lots of bars, pubs and restaurants around us.For any travellers would highly recommend the hotel.","June 5, 2019","2    Alcron Hotel Prague

Every single member of the staff was so accommodating, attentive and kind to me. My one-day visit was exceptional because of the hotel staff! The property is well-maintained, my room was very clean, and the guest experience team cared to make my short visit special by coordinating a guided tour on the same day. This hotel was recommended to me by a colleague several times. I am happy I finally made the trip and my only regrets are that I didn't come here sooner and that I wasn't able to stay longer.

Within 1 minute of arriving, our fears were dispelled and frankly, one of the friendliest and genuinely warm receptions I can ever remember - and I typically travel 50% of my time on business. From the valet parking to checking in, room allocation, recommendations, nothing was too much trouble. A special call out to Jana, their Guest Relations Director, who really went out of her way to ensure our stay was memorable. Reading some of the views, its clear that they mirror our own experience that customer service is front and centre focus of all the team that works there. Breakfast is superb and our room, the 'classic' was above our expectations. Prague is a beautiful city and the experience of discovering it was enriched by the Alcron Hotel. I would go back there in a heartbeat.. and even as we were leaving, had already starting working on when we could get back!

Cappuccinos and smoothies and everything you can hope for. One thing I was not so happy about was that our room was on the 2nd floor. I woke up on Sat at about 5:30 AM due to apparently garbage haul underneath us. I’m not happy to have my sleep interrupted on a short weekend break.

The staff were incredibly helpful throughout our stay, they were friendly, attentive and Leyla at the front desk really impressed my wife.Things to do in Prague:Charles Bridge (worth buying the ticket to go to the top as you get great views of the city) and the walk to Prague Castle. Make sure you where good shoes as the cobblestones and stairs do get slippery when wet.The old town square is something out of a movie - some of the best photo ops you’ll ever get.Have a meal at the Hotel U Prince rooftop - incredible views and the food is good too!","March 24, 2019","2    Alcron Hotel Prague

We didn’t like the room very much, seemed a little beat up with shabby carpets and AC wasn’t cooling as much as we would have liked but they offered to change rooms but we didn’t want to mess up another room so at check out they gave us free parking which would have been 15€ and we were happy with that, inside parking would have been 22€ I believe. Now the breakfast was insane, everything you could imagine, absolutely fantastic and we enjoyed it very much, much better than most of the better hotels we stayed at on the trip, so all in all we were very happy with our stay.","July 3, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

169,"Stayed at this hotel while on business and was very impressed with how welcoming the staff were. The hotel is nice and clean and the rooms a decent size. When I couldn't find anything I liked on the room service menu (bit limited for vegetarians) the chef created a special meal for me which was much appreciated. For breakfast there is a lovely large selection of just about everything you could think of - plenty of choice for everyone. Rooms are nice and quiet - you don't really hear your neighbours unless they are really banging the door loudly! Definitely recommend and would return. Just be aware that if you are here for the congress centre, it's about a 15 minute walk uphill - but there are plenty of Uber cars around if needed.","June 30, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

The hotel is about a 30 minute walk into the busy centre, but I actually quite liked that as it meant an opportunity to walk off any beer induced fuzziness / dumplings! It is close to several tram and train stops, so if you don't want to walk, that is an option too. The hotel is quiet and the area it is in are quiet, which I loved, the rooms are clean and the beds super comfortable, I slept very well the time I was there.

We were given Prague maps, and the tram network was explained to us how to catch the trams and buy a ticket from the hotel to the center of town. The main tourist sites are only four tram stops from the hotel. We were upgraded to a king bed from a queen bed which was nice. The hotel rooms are clean, spacious and the shower facilities modern. They include beautiful shower gel and hand wash, nice. We had the breakfast buffet daily included in our room rate the only criticism is that the temperature of the food was lukewarm and the coffee also was lukewarm. However the breakfast buffet had a vast selection of food which was great, pastries, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts.  We would definitely recommend this hotel for your Prague stay as the location is excellent as mentioned only a short tram ride away from all the major tourist sites i.e. town center and Charles Bridge.","June 12, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

175,"My wife and I stayed at the Park Inn for 3 days at the end of a 2 week European trip. It was great. We’re very sensitive to noise and always concerned about hotels in cities. The Park Inn did it right with their remodel with thick, double-paned windows, great insulation and very quiet air conditioning. Despite having tram lines close by, it was maybe the quietest city hotel room we’ve stayed at. Very clean and modern and an excellent breakfast buffet. The front desk staff were all helpful, but special praise goes to Stan who speaks excellent English and was especially friendly. We stayed in one of the Superior Terrace rooms, which was very spacious and had a big bathtub. Easy walk to the riverfront, but not in the overcrowded Charles Bridge and Old Town area. It was right near the Vysehrad Castle complex, which has great views and beautiful buildings in a park setting and was a wonderful respite from the crowded Prague Castle area. Our only regret, is not staying longer in Prague since there is so much to see. Thank you Park Inn and we will definitely recommend it to friends.","June 11, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

We walked into the town but you can get s tram at the end of the street. Don’t use the local taxis that pass if you want a taxi ask reception to call you one.

178,"This is a very nice hotel in nice location. The rooms are very large and comfortable. The bathroom is quiet large with shower. The hotel does not provide any bathroom amenities and there was not a hair dryer in the bathroom. I found it the work desk drawer. The bed provided an excellent night of rest as well. The wifi is very good and fast and no interruptions. There is good workspace desk in the room and a small refrigerator. There is an in-room safe. There is a coffee service as well with pot and some selection of instant coffee, sugar, etc. There is bottled water, but you have to pay for it. The breakfast is excellent with a huge selection of everything you would want from fruit, breads/pastries, meats/cheeses, scrambled/fried/hard boiled eggs, with sausages, tomatoes and baked beans, potatoes. There is coffee machine, but only has expresso, cappucino, hot chocolate selection. If you want instant coffee in large cup suggest you take the small instant coffee packets in your room and use the hot water at the breakfast service for instant coffee. The breakfast service might add these small instant coffee packets with the tea bags for people who prefer the instant coffee. The hotel is very close to the river and there are good restaurants in the nearby. The hotel restuaurant, RBG, is also good. There is plenty of trams available nearby for transport.

179,"It's located around a 25 min walk from Charles Bridge. It's maybe 35mins at a leisurely pace. The trams are plentiful and run till around midnight if you don't like to walk. You can get a 24hr ticket for about £4. It lasts 24hrs from the time you buy it so it's not just for a specific day. There's a market by the river which opens around 8am on Saturday, I think. It's a market which seems to be used mostly by locals for food shopping. There are a few things other than food but it's well worth a visit and the coffee we got from the mobile cart was great. Back to the hotel. It was very well staffed and they were all very helpful. A special thanks to David behind the bar who looked after us very well. He also worked in the restaurant in the evening and we saw him at breakfast too. Despite the fact he, and the rest of the staff worked long hours, he always had a smile for us when we saw him. Thanks David!The room was very clean and tidy and the shower was excellent. A well-stocked mini-bar is there if you need it also. The bed was comfy and large. Tea/coffee facilities are there along with the usual hairdryer and sewing kit! It was also a very quiet room which suited us perfectly. We were a little worried about noise from adjoining rooms but we hardly heard a sound from anywhere. We were located in room 440 which looks out to the side of the hotel so perhaps that's the place to be if you like quiet.Breakfast was also excellent and a good variety of things were available. No matter what your tastes are I'm sure you'd find something you liked.We ate in the restaurant on one occasion and the quality of the food, and the service was excellent.I'd have no hesitation recommending this hotel if you're planning to visit Prague.","May 24, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

The only problem we found is that when a couple stays in a room you would expect a double bed in the room instead of 2 single beds put together. The pillows also are not the best as too soft with not filling in it despite using 2 pillows. Apart from that everything else was very good and we enjoyed our stay.

The neighborhood was quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of tourists yet close enough by public transport or walking to be right in the middle of everything.

The bathrooms are lovely and equipped with soap and shower gel so no need to bring your own. The room is air conditioned and the windows also open for those who like fresh air. Even with the trams and trains passing outside the hotel, you can not hear them through the double glazed windows. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the centre using the pathways along the river for a pleasant walk with lovely views. On a Saturday morning there is a local market selling local produce, coffee, cakes and bakes as well as groceries and meat. There is a tram stop just along outside the hotel for those who do not like walking much. As we arrived late on Friday evening we had missed the hotel's food service and had a walk around outside to find somewhere, there is a tesco local store within the ground floor of the hotel, the entrance is on the opposite side to the hotel entrance and this is open until 9pm, there are also a selection of bars and restaurants nearby. We found a pizza takeaway just round the corner from the tesco entrance and a huge pizza was only the equivalent of GBP4 and it was superb. The place was called telepizza. On Saturday we ate in a local restaurant which was again superb. Prague itself is a lovely city with lots to explore and well worth a visit. ","April 24, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

It is very well kept and the service was always outstanding. Very close to a tram stop where a line that takes you to the old town (#17) passes by. A short walk gets you to 2 more tram stops for other lines. There’s a Tesco mini-market for basic groceries around the corner. Restaurant food is good too. The only comment for improvement I have is the availability of USB charging ports. With the ubiquity of cell phones and other devices I’m surprised that such hotel didn’t have a single direct to USB charging port. Even smaller / not as modern or new hotels have them.

204,"Park Inn Hotel Prague was fantastic! We travel 4-5 times (internationally and domestically) each year (leisure) and this hotel exceeded our expectations. Everything (and I mean everything) about Park Inn Prague was terrific. First, the reception desk staff - friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, pleasant (especially Stan). All staff, from front desk to bar to breakfast area to restaurant were exceptional. Next, the room - large, clean, had everything you need and quiet. The breakfast area was very, very large and had everything you could want or need (every day we found something new that we didn't know about the day before). The location was very good. Not in the ""old town"" but only a 10 minute tram ride away (you can buy tickets at the front desk) which was nice because it was away from the ""tourist"" area. There's a grocery store (Tesco) just behind the hotel which will save you some money for water, pivo and wine (as well as other things). Park Inn Prague was exceptional and the staff and people who work there were exceptional as well. We had to leave at 4 a.m. and they even provided us with a ""breakfast"" box to take to the airport with us. I couldn't wait to write a review (I just returned from Prague yesterday) and wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to all.","February 21, 2019","3    Park Inn Hotel Prague

Our expectations weren't up to much (we'd just had a lovely weekend in a very special hotel in the city) - but we were very pleasantly surprised! Considering the hotel had had 1/2 hours notice of 200 (unhappy) guests arriving - they were amazing! Not surprisingly, a bit of a queue to check in, but the staff were unfailingly polite and helpful. The room was excellent - clean, spacious, comfortable bed, etc (and quiet!) and the breakfast was very good. The hotel is located maybe a mile or so out of the centre, but it is a very pleasant walk along the river into town, or a short tram ride. There is a Tesco Express (surprisingly!) around the corner for anything you may need.

Located right next to the metro station so you are in Wenceslas Square in 10 minutes.

The room was also very tidy and had a really pleasant smell, just like the hallways and the rest of the hotel, which is a big plus for me. The breakfast was just amazing, so many choice and everything was delicious. You can find something for every taste. The staff is nice, friendly and very helpfull. I was amazed and the hotel has overcome my expectations. I couldn't be more satisfied. Thanks to everyone! We will come back for sure!","May 1, 2019","4    Don Giovanni Hotel Prague

246,I mainly chose the hotel for it's location near to Slavia Prague's football ground. Turned out to be well placed for public transport too as right next to the Metro and plenty of trams. Room was comfortable and certainly large enough for one. But I suggested it to two friends and they both ended up with suites!

248,"I've had high expectations about this hotel and really wanted to like it! However, this wasn't the case. If I ever visit Prague again, I will most definitely stay somewhere else. Here is the breakdown for you:PROS:- close to the metro (green line)- close to a supermarket (Lidl is across the street)- nice looking lobby- the Spa is decent, but a bit pricey for PragueCONS:-The mattress and pillows in our room were horrific- too soft and squishy. I couldn't sleep at all. There was a notice right next to the bed saying that you should go down to reception and ask for a different pillow and mattress if you don't like the current ones. I did...they said they don't have other ones! This is NOT a 4-star hotel answer. Don't advertise options, If you don't have any!-the twin delux room is just appalling. I've never seen such a budget room.- the ''executive rooms'' are what you would expect a normal room to be in a different hotel- the breakfast doesn't have much variety for a 4-star hotel. Sausages and eggs all day long.- the reception staff are not the friendliest by any means- the cleaning staff never replaced the shower gels and bathroom amenities - breakfast is until 10:30am and they start clearing-up on the dot. VERY LOUDLY- the toilets are weird","April 12, 2019","4    Don Giovanni Hotel Prague

249,"Lovely hotel on the outskirts of the centre of Prague. Comfortable beds (we had 4 in our room...2 pushed together as a double and a single either side)...don't know why we were given a family room...there were only 2 of us. The hotel was spotless. There's a Lidl supermarket right opposite..handy for water, snacks etc. The first time out of the hotel we didn't have a clue where to go or what tram/bus to get, or even where to BUY tickets for the tram/buses etc. Then we walked towards what we thought was a subway to cross the road and found to our amazement that it was a tube station! We asked at the kiosk in the station for a map (not sure what the kiosk is for - they DON'T sell tickets!) and we were given a map of Prague with all the tube stations, tram stops, bus stops clearly marked on it...along with the attractions. Fantastic! You cannot get lost..there are only 3 tube lines..A, B and C! We bought an all day ticket from the machine at the station that cost about CK105 (about £4) and that covered everything. Tube, trams and buses. Don't think it covered the main trains...you won't need those if you are staying inthe centre of Prague anyway. You can pay for the tickets by cash or credit card. Don't know what time the trains finished...we always were back at the hotel by 10-10.30..exhausted by then! Had breakfast once at the hotel...on the last day. We went out for breakfast, lunch and evening meals at various restaurants we looked up before we left home (we are vegetarians.)

The hotel is very easy to get from the airport - the hotel does offer a shuttle but we got a bus and metro which took around 35 mins and cost around £1 each! Rooms are very spacious, we had an executive room so we had access to the executive lounge which serves food and drink until 10pm - all included in the price at no extra charge! Breakfast is very good! Only downside we found was that there isn't ant air conditioning so all we could do was open a window, the hotel itself is very hot. Gym is not that big and well equipped so we went running outside instead.The hotel is next to a metro station (A) and has bus and tram stops outside, it's only around 15/20 mins to the main centre so really convenient!

On arrival was given a room on the 5th floor which on inspection was obviously not an executive room went down to complain and suddenly the receptionist couldn't speak English. After about ten minutes receptionist finally reappeared with a card for the 8th floor which actually said executive floor when we arrived. Went up to the 12th floor to look at the lounge to be refused entry because the entire Czech National football team was staying at the hotel and they took priority. Never got to use the lounge the entire 3 days we stopped there we got put into a little games room in the lobby with a few wilted sandwiches and a couple of bottles of beer.

Our standard room was more very spacious and more than adequate (they do more superior categories plus the option of the executive lounge facility) as a base for the frenetic city break scenario!The Don Giovanni staff were extremely helpful and the hotel, whist in the suburbs, had bus, tram and Metro stops tight outside, so the Prague Old Town was easily accessible in 10 mins for less than £1 each way.All-in-all a great spot that we fully recommend and will certainly stay at again, should we return to Prague.","March 3, 2019","4    Don Giovanni Hotel Prague

The concierge who was “helping” me had horrible service, talked in a rude tone, and refused to explain to me why I had received a confirmation email despite the payment not being processed. The hotel has 1 outlet. None close to the bed. So you would have to alternate charging of phones. Also the room reeked of cigarette smell????? In a non-smoking room???The cook during breakfast was literally racist. I asked him to make an omelette for my mom, and he just pointed at the pre made omelettes beside him.

Big thank you to Sophie the general manager who must have arranged the upgrade, you really did make our holiday one to remember.

Perks such as robes, chocolates, a small bottle of champagne, etc. generally come with higher-priced hotels. Because we had booked directly with the hotel, we were given a 500 crown credit for the restaurant which we used in the main restaurant for dinner one evening. The Creperie, a second restaurant connected to the hotel, was also good. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and included espresso drinks made to order. Our windows overlooked the street leading to the Charles Bridge but there was no noise. We stayed in the main hotel.

We were offered a breakfast package to take with us -which I regrest not taking with us as I am sure it would have been much better than the offerings in the airport lounge.As others have mentioned the hotel is situated under the Tower of the Charles Bridge - so it's a quick work across the bridge to visit old town and loads to expore on both sides of the river within easy walking distance (we are both over 60)With only 12 rooms this is a small hotel so book early so you are not disappointed.,"July 2, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

It was beautifully appointed with lovely wooden furniture, fast and efficient wi-fi and air conditioning, which was certainly needed during our short stay. You get a gift certificate for the restaurant and the excellent breakfast buffet is included. At the front desk they were a gold mine of information and they could not be more helpful in recommending where to go, and when to go to avoid crowds. They will make restaurant and taxi reservations and will sell you tram tickets that you can charge to the room. In fact they almost make you feel part of their family. Chocolates, or a bottle of sparkling wine appear in the room when you are out.I can’t imagine being treated any better at a grand five star hotel. Very, very highly recommended. Ask for number 11 and you will be delighted.","June 29, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

284,"We stayed at the Pod Vezi for four nights, arriving on the evening of 24th June 2019 and departing on the morning of 28th June 2019. A week or two before arriving, I contacted the hotel via email to say it was my partner’s birthday the day prior to arriving and that was the reason for our visit – then asked if they could provide anything for the birthday. They offered flowers but with the stay only being four days, I declined and went for the other offer of a lovely Czech chocolate cake and bottle of fizz. My partner Jo was overjoyed when she saw them, plus “happy birthday” balloons on the bed. Well done Pod Vezi, it was a lovely gesture.On arrival, we were allocated room 115 in the annex, which is less than a minute walk from the main hotel reception and building. The annex is a tidy and quiet building. The room was quite a lot smaller (it seemed) than many shown in the other pictures. Additionally, although an air-conditioning unit was in the room, it was a portable and not a fixed unit. With the temperatures reaching 38C in the daytime, the unit being on most of the day/night was a must. However, it was quite a noisy affair, not too dissimilar to having a tumble drier in the room rumbling away all day. The other negative was the lack of English-speaking TV channels on the television. Now don’t get me wrong, I rarely watch television at home, never mind when I’m on holiday so it wasn’t an issue to me but I can imagine it being a big problem to others. The only British channel available didn’t work either, leaving one American channel as the one single thing available.And so, to the positives. The most important hotel connected thing to me on my travels is sleep quality. The beds at the Pod Vezi are very comfortable and the rooms are so, so quiet at night. I slept like a log throughout each night. There was an ample supply of complimentary drinks & snacks in the fridge and the prices were reasonable. Likewise, the bathroom was well kitted out with complimentary shower gel, soap, shampoo – plus a hairdryer – everything you could need really. Breakfast each morning was excellent. The hotel is superbly located at the side of Charles Bridge, extremely handy for everywhere really. The staff simply couldn’t be faulted. We had a fabulous four nights there and will jump at the chance to stay at the Pod Vezi again. Highly recommended, don’t just look at it, book it!!","June 29, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

289,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Pod Vezi in one of their Superior Double Rooms located in the adjacent building. It is literally adjacent and right off of Charles Bridge which comes in handy to sneak out in the early morning or later in the evening to try to grab a photo without so many people on the bridge. The room we had in the adjacent building was very nice and had a window AC unit that cooled the room down in minutes. The breakfast was delicious and the staff at breakfast was very attentive and friendly. The front desk staff was also accommodating and offered suggestions and help on two different occasions. Location Good: I would say the right and perfect location for me because I wanted to be near the bridge and the Castle on the hill. I would say the food choices on this side of the river are not as much, BUT the restaurants they have on this side seemed to be the best. There were still hundreds of choices to select from.....basically if you are looking at the bridge from the hotel head right and any neighborhood before or after the local park alongside the river you will find some fantastic food options – one of the guided food tours I took had us going to five different places in and around this park, and all were great). Location Not as Good: If you like nightlife and the wilder side of Prague then anything near Mustek would be better for you. Old town and most of the other sites are on the other side of the river away from Hotel Pod Vezi but with that said the majority of them are very close and the walk across the bridge and to the start of let's say old town only adds on a half mile at most. I personally would try the other side just once and just to try it out, but I would most likely keep coming back to the Hotel Pod Vezi because it was a great experience with great staff and in a great location itself!","June 20, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

Our taxi driver was so lovely, full of information, very prompt and professional.Check in went very smoothly. All the young men on reception are so nice. We were given maps, information, trip advice, 15% discount of everything in the hotel restaurant, plus a voucher for 500 cz to use in restaurant also!We booked a suite, number 14, and it’s one of the most beautiful rooms we’ve ever stayed in. Looking out at 2 different aspects right next to the Charles bridge tower!Massive bed....so comfy, 5 large windows, lovely and light, sofa and desk, table and tub chairs, mini bar, ( reasonably priced), tea and coffee, (nespresso machine), bathroom with bath and shower, lots of toiletries, hair dryer, fluffy white towels. Absolutely everything you need.Housekeeping came in everyday, and we were left little gifts each time, which was a lovely touch. Flowers, chocolates, macarons, fruit bowl, cava, postcards. Very nice.Breakfast was great. Something for everyone. This was served from 7am TIL 10.30am.We thought the food in the hotel restaurant was fantastic, and very reasonably priced. We also tried a couple of other places nearby,...Tri Stoleti. Lovely ambience, fantastic service, but food was just ok. Best of all was Piknik Park. Beautiful setting by a small river, so pretty, and tranquil. Had the best Italian food, lovely wine, and service was excellent also. Would highly recommend this.We booked a couple of tours through the hotel. River cruise and guided walking tour which included boat trip, and medieval lunch.

We arrived exhausted after driving in the heat from Slovakia and found ourselves at this charming, lovely hotel in a magnificent position. We were welcomed warmly and were very pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to a junior suite. The room was absolutely lovely and very large with 2 rooms ( no. 22 in the main building). There were delicious chocolates and water in the room on arrival. After a big day exploring the castle and surrounds the next day, we found a bottle of champagne and some macaroons waiting for us in our room- what a lovely surprise! And much enjoyed!!

But the highlight is the staff. Every little detail taken care of. Even warnings of where to do currency exchange and taxis to avoid being scammed. Great English and even housekeeping managed all the little things to make your stay comfortable. And the food!!~ Fabulous buffet breakfast, and outside patio if you choose. Dinner was fantastic and well priced. A table next to us had Champagne and the waiter did a sabre bottle opening. Very impressive. When we arrived late they even recommended a great local spot for eats... enhanced the experience. Also since we had early flight to catch provide breakfast to go. Highly recommend Pod Vezi.","June 14, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

293,"This is our second visit to the Pod Vezi and we simply love being back here. We love all of the things that we loved the first time around - the proximity to everything, brilliant breakfast, fabulous staff and lovely rooms. All of the small details are taken care of fabulously. We are again in the annex building of the hotel and it’s very convenient to have the luxury of a little bit of extra room. The one thing that really sticks out is the cleanliness of the hotel. Nothing (and I really mean NOTHING) is out of place and the staff really look out for all of the small details. The extra touches such as fresh fruit, biscuits and chocolate are lovely and I love the convenience of tea and coffee in your room. The hotel has good WiFi throughout and there are discounts offered to both the restaurant and the creperie for guests of the hotel. One other benefit is that the hotel is really quite quiet, even though it is at the end of the Charles Bridge, where every man and his dog visits and that’s because of the lovely little square. Limited parking is available (but it needs to be booked in advance and available). But of course, a hotel is nothing but walls and beds without its staff and the Pod Vezi has some of the finest. We were very lucky that on many occasions we were assisted by Jerry. His knowledge and recommendations were excellent and he even sat in the car with me and assisted me navigate to the correct parking place. This genuine desire to assist is what will keep me choosing the Pod Vezi for any future stays in Prague.","June 13, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

295,"Our introduction to the hotel was its taxi service from the airport. Although our flight was delayed by about 2 hours, we were met by a smiling taxi driver and no extra charges for the time delay. How nice that they manage that! There were four of us and we had two rooms in the annex. Once settled in, I was looking at my map as we exited the building saying, ""Now, which way to the bridge?"" My clever child said, ""Look up Mom, It is literally just steps in front of you."" One pleasant surprise was an umbrella stand inside the building's front door. It rained our first full day in Prague. It was so thoughtful of the hotel to provide more than enough umbrellas for each of us to have a free umbrella for the day (on the honor system). Sometimes it is the seemingly little things that perk up one's day.The desk clerks were very helpful. We ate at two restaurants they recommended, which were perfect for what we had requested! We also bought tram tickets from them and arranged for our taxi to the train station when we left. We took advantage of the abundant free breakfasts, as well as a discounted (for hotel guests) dinner. Our room and beds were very comfortable. It was especially nice to be greeted upon arrival with fresh flowers and some chocolates in the room. We weren't in our rooms very much. When we did have a break in our main touring events, it was so convenient to go out for a little stroll on the bridge or along Kampa Island or to get a beer in an outdoor cafe. Our stay in Prague was simply charming. In a large part, that was due to Hotel Pod Vezi. Thank you!","June 9, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

Even though it is in a fun, active area we found both rooms we stayed in to be very quiet. The breakfast was ample, we were greeted with small gifts in our room every day, and the buildings themselves were quite charming. Note that one of our rooms was in the 2nd building and this was not a problem. Having said all this, the best thing about the Hotel was the staff. The front desk staff were terrific. They really went out of their way to be kind and helpful, explaining the tram system, dealing with our luggage during a room move (my fault, booked the wrong dates), and dealing with our transfer from the airport during multiple flight delays. The breakfast room and cleaning staff were equally good. If I had to come up with one criticism it would be that it was quite warm for our stay and the A/C in the room didn't quite keep up. I like it cool when sleeping.I highly recommend this hotel for a memorable stay in Prague.","June 5, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

The service was quite good, as were the restaurants. I found the staff to be very helpful and accommodating. Do take advantage of the free pass to climb the tower.A couple of quirks and issues.1. The restaurants allow you to charge the meal to the room, but not the gratuity. Thus be sure to bring some extra cash to pay the tip.2. I booked hotel transportation from the train station to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport by e-mail. No problem with the pickup. There was a disconnect with arranging the transportation from the hotel to the airport. Thus they expect you to reconfirm the transportation to the airport.3. They were kind enough to give me a courtesy late check out because of some health issues of my father, but must not have communicated with the maids, since one of the maids walked in on me without knocking during the extension period. Thus, be sure to lock the door.","May 21, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

The hotel organised our taxi, the driver was very informative giving us useful information about Prague and the hotel. At the reception the lady was really nice and also gave us lots of information that was really helpful. Rooms were big and spotlessly clean, everything you needed and mini bar was reasonably priced. Chocolates and water in the room on arrival, lovely touch. Breakfast was excellent and lots of choice. Prosecco served at the weekend which was also a nice touch! All the staff we met during our stay were very polite, friendly, really helpful and went the extra mile. As it was a birthday celebration we asked the hotel if there was anything they could do to make it special! They organised some balloons and table confetti for breakfast. Sparkling wine on ice and champagne flutes during the day, which we took up to the roof terrace.That night we ate in the hotel restaurant....make sure you book as it was full and people were turned away without a booking. Fantastic food from start to finish, it really was superb and the waiting staff were friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. Dessert was finished off with a sparkler for the mother in law and the staff sang happy birthday! What a top hotel! Great location next to the Charles bridge.

310,"Hotel Pod Vezi is a tidy, immaculate hotel in the Mala Strana district of Prague, with a superb location. Out the door and around the corner, and down the lane a few yards is the Karluv (Charles) walking bridge to the other side of the river. Once inside the hotel, you may hear conversation and laughter from the outdoor cafes, but you won't hear traffic and crowds of rowdies as you might on the other side of the river! We were surprised upon arriving that the staff had upgraded us to a suite in the main building: a very spacious room with high ceilings, a generous sitting area, large bath, and many windows for air and light. Large comfortable bed, and a vase full of big red roses made this accommodation a lovely place. The breakfast area is small but the offerings are excellent: hot and cold items frequently refreshed, appealing to both European and American taste. Computer access in the lobby, with advice from the front desk, made it easy to get maps and directions. Please know that this is a small hotel without a 24/7 housekeeping staff, and any requests go to the front desk which is minimally staffed at night.(We observed one lady who was frustrated at having to get her own ice, for example.) The hotel is not an American-style mega hotel, thank goodness, nor a cookie-cutter limited service budget property (I stay in plenty of those for work).

As the first time traveling to Prague, Mr. Jaroslav provided us necessary info regarding the city and surrounding areas. Very attentive and service-minded. We both work in hotel industry for over 15 years, we really have to give big compliment to him. Also, Mr. Ladi who proactively helped us with internet connection and offered assistance to recommend choices of transportation to us. The room is in a very good and clean condition, water pressure and temperature are extremely convenient. Dining experience was also excellent. We will definitely stay in this hotel when we return to Prague. Thank you!","May 7, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

314,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 days before I had a business trip scheduled in Prague. We took a chance and relied on the reviews we saw Trip Advisor!! The reviews were spot on. This wonderful little Hotel at the base of Charles Bridge was perfect. They arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport, we asked for some fresh fruit in the room which was delicious and they surprised us with a small gift. They gentlemen at the desk were polite and very helpful. Our room was appointed very nicely. The ceilings in our room were at least 12ft high and had incredible woodworking details on the ceiling. We stayed in one of the suites with a separate sitting room which made for a comfortable stay. Breakfast was plentiful and let of our package stay. We did eat at the hotel restaurant. My husband said his veal steak was one of the best he had ever tasted. The hotel provided complimentary umbrellas, which we needed. The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to be in the thick of the sightseeing action. We loved our stay and would recommend it to anyone making their way to Praha!","May 5, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

315,"My daughter and I just stayed at Hotel Pod Vezi (“Under the Bridge”) for the past week, and our experience was fantastic. The location is just off the Malá Strana side of the Charles Bridge, literally in the shadow of the bridge tower, but just enough off the Main Street to feel a bit quieter. Prague is very walkable, and we only needed to use the tram system a few times—this is a very central location for the main sights. Our room was in the Dependency building across the street, and it was quite comfortable, with a very modern and clean bathroom, but also high ceilings and exposed timbers. We enjoyed going up the old wooden steps with a sag in the middle, reminding us of the age of our building.The staff was great from start to finish, everyone we dealt with, but special kudos go to Milos, who we dealt with the most. When pharmacies were closed for Labor Day holiday, he came up with some Zyrtec for my daughter. Also, there were daily special treats left in our room, of both the edible and artistic sort.I believe this may have been our best hotel experience in a European country, and at a very reasonable cost. Don’t hesitate to book.","May 4, 2019","5    Hotel Pod Vezi

The bar is great with happy hour beers going for about $1.50. Made lots of friends there. As most hostels in Prague are, it is about a 30 minute walk from most of the Old Town tourist attractions. However, the tram has a stop right outside the hostel. Ubering anywhere you’d want to go is around $5 or less, depending on the time of day. The only con is the wifi sometimes isn’t great from your bed, but it works fine in the common areas and everywhere else. I fully recommend this hostel!!!","July 7, 2019","6    Czech Inn

The only downside are the room key cards. 1. they demagnetize quite easily when in contact with your phone, 2. we needed two seperate key cards in order to get into our room and 3. you need key cards quite often to access several doors or the elevator which is overall quite inconvenient.

It is always completely clean and hygienic, the space itself is super cozy, both in the corridors and the rooms and the reception. Their breakfast buffet is awesome, for really cheap you can eat a real banquet, it has all you can imagine. The people who work there are friendly and professionals, I have to highlight the service of Alissa, Adam and definitly Simona, who ALWAYS worries to provide the best customer experience... I am still delighting with this Hostel and their workers and I also want to come back again, well, you can always do that because they have one of the best bars in the area where you can go as a hostel customer or just someone from outside, there's a different shows almost every night, the decoration is fantastic and they have every kind of drinks and of course the best beer...

332,"Recently visited needing a room for myself and rooms for 4 undergrads, so had the opportunity to experience both ""hotel"" and ""hostel"" rooms.Quite pleased to find that the website is spot on as to what to expect: so no surprises... it's a hip, clean, fresh, modern hostel/hotel! Modern renovation of classic rooms mean for high ceilings and bright windows overlooking the neighborhood. My room was above the tram line which stops running at midnight...I had no problems. Reception staff are excellent, and there is English fluency. I had a last minute problem with a student with no reservation, no plastic, and no crowns and they were still able to give him good shelter with Euro. Despite what it says on the website, the older traveler who is comfortable with hostel travel will find this an enjoyable stay. Prices reflect the Francouszka neighborhood which is just a short 3 stops on the 22 Tram from I.P. Plavlova metro. Frankly, given the crowds down in the Old Town, this place is a quiet relief. Friendly Bar at night, Breakfast available in morning. Quick access to a good ATM in lobby, and several minimarts and good neighborhood cafes in the surrounding neighborhood. Overall a perfect launch pad for the cost-conscious Prague tourist (students, families, and young at heart will enjoy this place).","April 6, 2019","6    Czech Inn

354,"We stayed at the Czech Inn in Prague as part of our interrailing trip and we were not expecting how incredible our private room turned out to be! The bathroom had a waterfall shower and the double bed was extremely comfy. After travelling on a hot train all day, we felt completely spoilt by the room. Staff on the reception desk recommended that we explore the area of Vyšehrad that evening which was beautiful and so I’d recommend asking them for any tips for hidden gems! Breakfast was cheap and the selection was great. I really can’t fault the hostel at all and I would definitely stay here again when visiting Prague!","August 27, 2018","6    Czech Inn

355,"Stayed in a private room, which was very spacious for two people. Cafe on first floor had nice sandwiches and coffee drinks. Bar in basement had small, but good selection of domestic beers. Staff organizes many social activities, so if traveling by yourself there are several opportunities to interact with other guests. A free walking tour is also available to guests at the hostel. Located in a residential neighborhood that is farther out from the central city, so commute can be long to the sights. However, it is a much quieter area, which makes it more restful.","August 25, 2018","6    Czech Inn

359,"I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Prague.Good PointsThe Hostel is clean, well presented, modern and quite fashionable if that is the right word. It's very nicely designed. The floors are very smooth, clean and nice to the touch. Showers were also good and just outside of the rooms so you don't have far to walk. The rooms are very cheap as well.It was easy to rent towels, buy shower gel or soap from the desk which was great as I forgot something. The bar downstairs provides drinks and very basic food. The bunk beds have solid lockers under them to keep your luggage safe.The mexican restaurant down the street was superb and highly recommend a visit. We went for steaks twice.My sleep was good as it's not a noisy part of town. The other guests were considerate. Obviously you do get usual hostel issues such as people coming in from airports in the middle of the night but that happens in all locations unfortunately. The hostel mainly has younger guests in it like many hostels.The trams go right down the side of the hostel. But this allows you to get around very easily once you have found the place.Bad PointsThe rooms smelt in the morning but opening the windows sorted that out.It's a long way from the city centre so you have to get a tram into town and cannot walk it. We got a taxi from the airport which helped us to get there but cost us extra money.My friend stepped out in front of a car by accident as we were coming out of the hostel so be careful as the front of the building.","July 30, 2018","6    Czech Inn

The rooms were clean with large lockers, as well as charging ports (usb ports included) for your phone inside the bed bunk. The washrooms were all clean and surprisingly aesthetic. The floor layout was a bit confusing but this is hardly something to complain about. The bar downstairs seems to have a lot going on, and the staff keep a list of events going on around the city. You can borrow a hair dryer with a deposit. ","July 28, 2018","6    Czech Inn

362,"First let’s hit the good. The double room was spacious and clean. It included a sink and the beds were ample. I liked the individual charging stations with each bed and table and shelf space in addition to the under-bed lockers. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful (if not always truthful) and were sympathetic to our complaints. Now the complaints. Most everything was broken most of the time. No stair access and you had to use the elevator. Until it broke. No pancakes at breakfast, the pancake machine was broke. No laundry facilities, broke. Problems with internet in rooms, broke. When we arrived, the only men’s stall, broke and disgustingly clogged. Lock on said door? Broke. In fact, on a floor of 12 dorms and rooms, one men’s stall, one urinal and one unisex bathroom (which often had women in it). Not my first hostel by any means and maybe this passes for a “Great Hostel of Europe” (advertised) in Prague. I was not impressed.","July 17, 2018","6    Czech Inn

The beds were very comfy and clean as well as the bathroom which was modern and spacious. My only issue was the underbed storage, which was a little annoying to keep pulling out and unlocking when someone was sleeping in the bottom bunk. It was also very social, the bar was good fun and there were events often. The old town was a tram ride away and it felt very safe around the hostel. It also had a kitchen and laundry if needed.

The only drawback of the stay is most of the people in the hotel are around the ages of 21-25. If you are looking for an older crowd, then this might not be the place to stay. Another thing I noticed that the staff hangout with the guests on a daily basis. The staff drinks with the guests in the bar downstairs, which I thought to be a little strange and unprofessional. When staff gets off, they hang around the hostel and drink with the guests. It is definitely a great place, if you are around the ages I previously mentioned. ","June 20, 2018","6    Czech Inn

Ask for the free drink coupon to Krcna at the front desk - its a medieval tavern with good Czech food.The fact that the bar was in the basement helped me be able sleep at night and the bar was never too noisy anyway. My room of 8 beds for girls only had a bathroom, sink, and shower inside which was so convenient compared to the walk to bathrooms in other hostels where you have to carry all your stuff back and forth. I found that I couldn't stand the tourist trap center of Prague - the location of the Czech Inn in the Vinohrady/Vrsovice neighborhoods was awesome to get the daily life feel of the city outside of the crazy center with tons of summer school trips and tourists.","May 25, 2018","6    Czech Inn

Tram line 22 is right there which is helpful when trying to get into the city centre. Super easy to get to from the main train station. All you need to do is get a transit ticket once at the train station, you can also get them at the hostel. The buffet breakfast was totally worth it if you like to eat a variety of stuff. Had hard boiled eggs, crepes, fruit, bread, sandwich meat, yogurt, tea, etc. Staff was very helpful with any questions we had. Each night there was also something fun going on at the hostel. The Happy Hour is AMAZING! It wasn't that busy but the pricing on the certain drinks is worth it before heading out to drink.Clean! Even though the shower and bathroom area is quite dark in the basement it is super clean and the showers were awesome. Always had hot water and incredible like rain shower head!Take advantage of the free tour, takes you around a lot of the city and guide talks about a lot of the dos and don'ts, different pubs, history, etc. From that tour we signed up for a Beer Tour... TOTALLY WORTH IT! We had such a fun time, learned a lot and drank even more!FUN FACT: Book on the Czech Inn website and you can receive some discounts - such as a free drink at the bar or kafe that is there and sometimes a certain % off your entire stay.","May 8, 2018","6    Czech Inn

375,"This hostel is apart of the St Andrews chain. Their facility was clean, modern and spacious. I was in between here and sir Toby’s hostel. I’m comfortable with my decision though wonder what the other would have been like. The bar downstairs was nice. Their happy hour beers are dirt cheap for anyone coming from euros, pounds or USD. I didn’t feel a communal hostel vibe that I’ve had at others but not a big deal. Hostel is located right across the street from the tram. The map they give out at check in is surprisingly an immense help. Be sure to ask them what deals they can provide on attractions. Wound up getting a free beer coupon for the ice bar which is where I was already going. The hostels breakfast was....sad. For the price you can step next door and get something better. I appreciate the effort but hot dogs being passed off as breakfast sausage is a crime.I stayed in a solo room. It was clean, had a vanity which was super nice and the bedding was comfortable. The communal showers were nice and cleaned daily. The laundry facility onsite cost $5usd for wash/dry (total). The (cute) brunette at the counter was a terrific help and always had the best recommendations. I have nothing bad to say about this place but suggest their breakfast improve and possibly the staff be more involved to get hostel guests to mix and mingle more. (There are bar activities in the hostel bar but they’re more karaoke style). Tram ride into old town was maybe 15 minutes. Never had transportation issues. ","May 3, 2018","6    Czech Inn

376,"Stayed here for 4 nights and I absolutely love this hostel. Firstly, the staff were quite helpful with providing the information you need about the city. Furthermore, I forgot to bring a safe lock but this hostel provides free lock rental (refundable deposit needed) and thumbs up for this. Secondly, this hostel lies in a good location whereby the tram station is just a stone throw away. I was able to go to most attractions via this tram station. I feel that although it's not exactly right smack in the middle of the city, it's actually as good as being in the city in my opinion.Last but not least, I stayed in a 30 plus pax shared a room but I don't feel that this place is too crowded or rowdy at night. The toilet and washroom are AMAZING I have to say. It really exceeded my expectations and was also very clean (I saw housekeeper cleaning every afternoon).The only downfall is probably their pancakes during breakfast (you've to pay for it). I didn't quite like the pancake batter and I felt that maybe it could be improved on? That's all and I really enjoyed my stay here thank you.","April 28, 2018","6    Czech Inn

395,"We stayed at the Grandium Hotel from the 14-18th of June, it is situated on a side street in the main town area , within easy walking distance to sightseeing , we were impressed right from word go ,extremely clean hotel reception , staff were polite and attentive, our room was not ready as we arrived early but the staff took our luggage and stored safely for us , after a couple of hours we returned. And our room was ready, our luggage was taken to our room which was on the 3rd floor, the staff member told us everything we needed to know room wise.Although our room did not have a view it was not a problem as we would only really be sleeping in it! , our room was a spacious Deluxe room with ensuite bathroom , flat screen tv , safe , tea/coffee making facilities, immaculately presented throughout, bed was extremely comfortable as were the big pillows. We ate at the Hotel InGarden Restaurant on the first night, we weren’t disappointed food was excellent as was the service, special mention to Mirka our waitress, she was attentive polite and smiley. Breakfast in the hotel was also great, wide choice of breakfast foods, cooked buffet, omelettes made to order, juice, pastries , fruits , bread , cereals , as well as hot drinks choices, Mirka was working again and made a point of coming over to us to wish us good morning etc, she works extremely hard and was there everyday , morning and evening apart from one! , everything about this hotel was wonderful , thank you for a lovely time ","June 19, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

The hotel was very busy but still very quiet overnight. It seems like a lovely restaurant/cafe within the hotel but with plenty of choices around the hotel we didn’t have the chance to try any food apart from breakfast.

409,"Most hotels with all the A list items are two to three times the money. My sister stayed at a hotel that was three times the money and I still like this one better. Location is one block off a major shopping boulevard and a fifteen minute walk to the old historical area and the Charles bridge. If you decide to take a taxi it was very reasonable. Save your money for a wonderful dinner at Kampa Park and stay here. One thing to note. The breakfast buffet is amazing here every morning. Don't miss this. There are eight elevators in this hotel, yes, I said eight and you have to pay attention which elevator goes to what rooms. This hotel is full of mirrors and hallways that all look alike, so there is a learning curve to find your way around. A room key swipe is necessary to activate the elevator.

We had a problem with our room but we were quickly moved to another room with the help of the bellboy.Room was very clean and nicely furnished. The whole hotel looks like it has had a renovation as there was not one thing we could find that didn’t work. no chipped tiles or damaged paintwork.Buffet breakfast was included and it had a great variety. Omelettes could be made to order as well. Only thing I could ask It would be nice to have a mug of tea instead of a small cup. Wifi was also included and worked perfectly.Hotel was close to everything shops cafes restaurants all attractions like Prague Castle Charles Bridge Wenceslas Square.

As well as juices/wine/ coffees and teas- breakfast was always perfect and we looked forward to this every morning. Food was so fresh and well prepared and staff were ever so lovely and attentive. Eating area was gorgeous too and spacious.

414,"Grandium hotelThis is definitely not a 5 star hotel. More like 3.5. The rooms are actually ok and the bathroom decor is fine but the shower is a joke. It’s a shower head over the bath with really weak pressure, but worse than that is that you can’t avoid getting the bathroom soaking wet if you have a shower. The shower door only covers about 30% of the bath, so water just pours out onto the floor. There was a lot of noise from a building site nearby, hammering and drilling. This started at 7am in the morning. We like to sleep late when we’re on holiday and this made it impossible. They should have warned us in booking that there would be a lot of noise in the morning. The breakfast buffet was fine if you avoid the hot buffet which wasn’t nice. Cold buffet was ok, as was the fruit and pastries. The worst thing was the hotel restaurant which was just depressing. We should have realised when we went in on a Saturday night and it was empty, despite the hotel being full. It serves mainly reheated Chinese food cooked and served by Czech people. Even the waiter looked embarrased to be serving it. It’s a very popular tourist hotel, with a constant flow of Chinese and American coach parties, but way off being anywhere near 5 star. Lastly, the staff are not that friendly or helpful. ","May 29, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

421,"We just spent 3 nights at the Grandium Prague and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.LOCATION:One of the key selling features for us was that it's located within short walking distance from the main train station so it's very convenient for rail travel. There's also an Airport Express bus that travels to the station and for less than $2 you can easily get to the hotel. It's around the corner from Wenceslas Square, a 10 minute walk from Old Town Square, and 20 minutes from the Charles Bridge. BREAKFAST:Our stay included a breakfast buffet that was really good with lots of selection of both hot and cold items, pastries, waffles, and a made-to-order omelette station.ROOM:We booked a classic room which was no frills, but it was clean and met our needs. However, if we return I'll likely try moving up a room category. What we didn't like:1. The mattress was very firm making it a bit uncomfortable for sleeping, but the pillows were great. It was fine for a short stay, however I wouldn't be able to sleep on it for a week.2. The bathroom had a tub with high sides (this may not be suitable for seniors who have mobility issues) and the shower head (while removable) was placed too low for anyone who's tall. There was also no shower curtain (just a half glass wall) resulting in water sometimes pooling on the floor. You may want to inquire about a walk-in shower instead.3. Our room faced an interior courtyard which was quiet at night, but the door to the room is quite thin so hallway noise was a problem at times.SERVICE:The staff are professional, friendly and service-oriented. You can tell they are well-trained to take care of guests. Cleaning staff also did a great job maintaining our room.The only other comment I'll make is that the Grandium seems to cater to large bus tours so it gets very busy at times, especially the breakfast buffet between 6:30-7:30 am. That being said, we never had issues finding a table.Overall, you can't go wrong staying here. Prague is a very walkable city with lots of transportation options so don't feel that you need to stay right in Old Town Square.","May 23, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

The rooms are large and as modern as they can be - my only slight issue was the black marble bathroom which, when it was wet,got very very slippery but they always provided enough towels to cover the floor so this again wasn’t a deal breaker.Their bar is great, unfortunately we never sampled the food as we tended to go out for dinner, but their happy hour and cocktail menu was fab- the staff were lovely, even letting us continue drinking until 11:30pm when we had definitely had enough! Location is PERFECT, it’s just far enough away so you’re not in the middle of the madness but it’s still close enough that everything is in walking distance.

The couch and arm chairs were so small and low to the ground that they were almost unusable. The room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the entrance. The road outside is all cobblestones and we heard every vehicle go by as if they were in the room. Add to this the garbage trucks turned up at 5.30 every morning making sure we could not sleep in. We could hear every conversation taking place outside on the footpath each night and in the room next door as the wall are paper thin. We had a group of men with raised voices next door going on well in to the night and calls to reception about the noise were ignored. This went on for three nights giving us little sleep.The reception staff were polite and helpful with maps when we arrived. The breakfast has a large variety of choices with the breakfast room being very busy with tour groups etc. The dining room is temporarily located next to the front door so you see and hear all the heavy foot traffic while dining.This is not a five star hotel, it struggles to be a four star hotel compared to our stay in Berlin at the Steigenberger hotel or the Hilton in Munich where we also stayed on this trip.","May 5, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

434,"Stayed for a weekend in March 2019.This hotel was really good value for the price that we paid. Location is just off Wenceslas square and is about a 15 min walk into the old town centre. It’s a much larger hotel than we first thought with a big reception area and always lots of people coming and going, though there once in the room there wasn’t much noise to disturb at night.Breakfast was included in the price and again it was always busy there, though there wasn’t a wait for tables and the buffet provided pretty much everything one could want. There was a bar and restaurant at the front of the hotel too, though looking at the prices they charged we didn’t bother using them.The room was well appointed, a good size and was clean. Bed was comfortable. All the staff we dealt with were helpful and the reception staff gave us lots of free maps and guides when we first checked in.Overall very pleased with the hotel and we would stay here again.","May 1, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

437,"We spent 4 nights at the Grandium. The room was quite large with a king size bed. The decor was modern. There was a good size closet with hangers. The safe was located in the closet. There were also some shelves for foldables. There was not a dresser with drawers. The view from our room was of the other wing of the hotel. The room was very quiet.A breakfast buffet was served every morning and it was excellent. It came as part of our tour package so I don’t know what the cost would have been if traveling alone. It was fairly close to the old town and museum, however we did walk over 10,000 steps every day for the time we were there.There were many local restaurants close by if you don’t want to eat lunch and dinner in the hotel but they do serve dinner there.","April 28, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

438,"The hotel is quite anonymous on the street except that it is painted pale yellow. The entrance has the restaurant to the right and the bar/lounge to the left as you approach the reception area. Plenty of shiny, bright mirrored walls make it look enormous. Our room wasn't ready so we left our bag with the concierge and went to explore. It probably is approximately 7 minutes to Wenceslas Sqaure by foot and perhaps 15 to the Old Town. Check in was at 3.00pm but our room was ready by 2.00pm. The lift is operated by your room key and after discovering that floor 2 was only 1 floor up we used the stairs after that. The corridors were very modern with large photos of the city between the rooms. The room was clean and modern with some very strange angels. The bathroom was tiled in black with l'occataine products. There were towelling dressing gowns and slippers to use. One comment really was that the towels could have been newer and more fluffy and when they were changed they were not the same size as the previous ones. There was tea and coffee making facilities and a mini bar. Tip: buy your water from around the corner for 49czk for a 1.5 litre bottle instead of 1 litre for 90czk. The instant coffee in the room was horrible and bitter so we didn't try again with that. There was quite a lot of noise that was too easy to hear from the room as people passed by and opened and closed doors. The curtains didn't keep the light out so early morning the room was really bright. The breakfast service was in a restaurant at the back of reception and it was busy. Really well stocked and multiple stations located around the full area of the restaurant meant that queuing was limited. There was an omelette and waffle station and a pianist playing in the corner. The best way to describe it was if you have ever been on a cruise ship then this was very close to the breakfast service. In the afternoon of the second day we returned to the room about 3.00pm and there was some work being carried out close by which was noisy and disruptive. We went down to reception to point it out and after a short discussion were given vouchers for a drink in the bar which was fine. Apparently this hotel has 98% occupancy year round and whilst we were there, there must have been at least three tour groups in. The staff were helpful and friendly and there were plenty of smiles. I do know that there is no definitive star rating internationally and would probably rate this 4* rather than 5* and we chose it because it included breakfast as well as the location. In the corridor an appliance was plugged into the wall with a cable that ran the length of the corridor to what we don't know but it was there much of the day and we had to step over it. Some guests might not be able to see it and it was a hazard. I would have no hesitation recommending the Grandium for a short visit to Prague.","April 27, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

439,"To celebrate the birthday of my wife on the 3rd of April we had arranged to take a city break in Prague.We travelled out by Easy Jet on an Airbus 320 aircraft. The flight was uneventful save that when we left Gatwick the weather was miserable and when we landed at Prague it was a lovely spring day, and stayed like that the whole time that we were there.Our transfer to the Hotel was by taxi which gave us our first sight of the city, which looked more than promising.. The hotel entrance looked plain but once inside the lobby area it opened out into a modern, much mirrored reception area where we were soon welcomed and given our room, I think it was number 355, which faced out onto the road that we had just arrived on.. The room itself was simply but comfortably furnished and had an excellent bathroom with all the usual facilities.. As it was by now latish in the afternoon we went exploring to find a restaurant for our evening meal. My wife used her smart phone to track down a place called ""Meat Beer"". On entering it seemed that we had entered a cellar. We were shown to a table and our waitress presented us with a menu, fortunately in English, for us to choose our dinner. We both choose duck pate for a starter and duck breasts for our main course. The food was excellent and was washed down with a large glass of the local brew. Next morning we had breakfast at the hotel and were pleasantly surprised at the vast choice available. We were greeted with a glass of sparkling wine which we both agreed was a charming touch. We were within a steady walking distance of Wenceslas Square, he of the Christmas Carol and his tomb is in St. Vitus Cathredal. The weather was warm so we restricted our travels that day. Prague has a marvellous tram system, also a metro and bus service.It was only 110 Kc for a 24 hour transfer ticket valid on all three. Pensioners over 70 travel free but you may need to carry some proof of age, I used my UK bus pass but was not required to show. it. We took a trip on tram route 9 right to the end of the line and then back into the centre of the city. During the journey we passed a large tram depot and saw a museum dedicated to the Trabant car!We had booked in advance a two day ticket on one of the tourist Hop on - Hop off buses. We thought that as we were no longer in the first flush of youth, that we would see most of the city in comfort and could listen to the commentary in English. There were three different routes and over the time available we covered them all.Prague is such an interesting city that I would urge you all to go there. We only managed to scratch the surface of Prague, with a country of 240 breweries and goodness knows how many different beers. We learnt that the good citizens of Prague drink at least one and a half litres of beer a day. To uphold the Spirit of Great Britain we did likewise and hope to return for a longer stay in the future..","April 26, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

441,"The hotel was really nice and easy to find. The lobby is very nice but the room is very simple, especially the cheaper rooms (which were overly warm - even the air conditioning didn't help with this!), so it didn't really feel like a 5 star experience after leaving the lobby. When we arrived in the room, we were a bit shocked to discover some small spatters of blood on the bedsheets but we phoned down to the lobby and they sent housekeeping to change them straight away. They also sent up a fruit plate as way of an apology. The best part of this hotel is that they offer a very good driver service which you can book in advance. This is very cheap and an excellent way to get around the city.","April 24, 2019","7    Grandium Prague

The bedrooms are a good size, as are the bathrooms, ours featured a walk in shower, complete with bathrobes and slippers! There are lifts to every floor. Breakfast is buffet style and vast. Honestly the amount of food on offer was insane, there's even a waffle and omelette station! Perfectly located less then 5mins from the main train station, or about 40mins in a car with traffic from the airport. For venturing out on foot, you couldn't ask for a better location, 5mins walk to the main square, 10mins to Charles Bridge, surrounded by plenty of eateries and shops.

449,"We would rate this hotel a 5 on 5 on location and the breakfast . The hotel is in the old part of the town , very close to the Wenceslas square . Lots of options to eat nearby. Nearest metro station is Musetec and Mueseum. You can even walk to Charles Bridge and Astronomical clock area. The only downside of the hotel was the room . We had booked a triple room but we got a double room with an extra bed put up which made the room very cramped . The plan of the room is not very good with no full size cabinet to store your luggage near the door. There is a cupboard next to the bed to keep some stuff but suitcases have to stay on the floor itself . There is no shower cubicle , rather just a bathtub with only half of it covered by glass enclosure . There was no view in the room . Beds were not very comfortable and would shake anytime one moved while sleeping . However breakfast was great with lots of options and live piano. Staff in the restaurant was pleasant and efficient .

Located in the district of Vršovice you will not run into masses of tourists before you've even had coffee, but have some very nice breakfast (homemade jam, vegan options etc.) and get excellent tips on how to spend your day or have an interesting conversation with one of the hosts.The tram stop is 1 minute away and it will bring you right into the center within 15 minutes. Staying in the area is also a good idea, as there are lovely cafés, restaurants and parks around.The rooms are cozy, clean and also funny (you will see), the beds are big and comfortable.

It was really awesome to discuss every morning at breakfast with Guenther about many things. I think he is the best by far to introduce you Prague (especially with his ""walking seminars"") and, though I spend 8 days in his pension, I feel it was too little to learn whatever I would.Pretty good and enough breakfast, with home made jams from Guenther's sister (credits) and some local products. And always with the really kind reminder from Guenther and Jan (his colleague) ""if you need something else, feel free to express it""I estimate also the environmental sensitivities they run their pension.Really, very nice people with quality and many services they offering, without to press you.

They provided excellent advice/recommendations of sights to see, places to eat, and things to do! Every morning there was a delicious breakfast spread that is included in your stay, there is so much food it fills you up and leaves you happy! One of the hosts is always there during breakfast so if you ever have any questions or requests they are happy to help you and have interesting conversations with you. They keep the rooms very clean and would schedule times with us to come in and clean for us which was very nice! They also have laundry service on site, and kindly washed and dried our clothes as well as folded them. We would put the clothes out in the morning and they were often back by the evening! The location is also excellent, it is in walking distance of many grocery markets, restaurants, and a tram stop is just steps away.

We knew we’d landed as there were the telltale plants hanging outside, which was one of the reasons I chose to stay here. I trust green fingered folks.Guenther was kind enough to meet us in the middle of the night and let us in. Our EasyJet flat meant we landed at an awkward unsociable hour after 10.30pm. The reception both from Guenther and the place was exactly as anticipated, warm, friendly and inviting. Guenther gave us a stack of leaflets, a Fodor’s Travel guidebook of Prague (more comprehensive than the one I bought – Lonely Planet Pocket Guide), picture book of the architecture in Prague; great information on Churches/the Castle etc. No one could say we were unprepared for Prague. We were armed and ready to…take photos and explore.We were given three keys to our access our room, the outdoor key, a key to get into the apartments and our flat key. It felt super safe.The room itself was clean, fresh and heated up when we arrived, with soft lighting. I could have easily moved in permanently! If you want to see Prague on a super tight budget, there’s a kitchenette that comes with fridge, sink, pots and pans and hot plate. There’s a little area for table and chairs, a desk, a library, free coffee and coffee making facilities. The beds were a dream to sleep on and we were nice and toasty in the night. The street is quiet and far out of reach from rowdy stag and hen dos. The only thing I had to contend with was my mate snoring like a bear!Wholesome breakfast consisted of bread, cheese, salami, tomatoes, cucumber, yummy biscuits, yoghurts, apples and coffee to die for!Jan and Guenther recommended some veggie restaurants which were delicious; Maitrea and Lehka Hlava. Krčma was another awesome suggestion for a local authentic Czech restaurant. Highly recommend.Please visit – it’s lovely. :)","January 22, 2017","8    ARCO Guesthouse

But Guenther was waiting for us, keeping the lights on, as welcoming as if he hadn't had to wait until midnight to welcome us. And that set the tone: the room was just what we needed (comfortable, clean, quiet); the location is perfect--outside the crush of Old Town, etc., but a very easy tram (#22) that goes all the way to the Castle)--when you stay there, make sure to explore the neighborhood, especially the vineyard park. Breakfast was lovely and enough to keep us going through our perambulations (great coffee!) and included the company of Guenther or Jan and as much (or as little) advice and direction as one could wish for. And, to cap it off, we asked Guenther for one of his tailored and reasonably priced walking tours--just the two of us with him for 7 hours and now I understand *so* much of Prague's history--political and cultural--as well as its geography. Finally, we feel like we made friends we want to visit again.

He helped us plan our tours around Prague, taking into account the weather that day, what exhibitions we could be interested in, which museums were open and what concerts or jazz places we could go to see in the evening. Our first time visit to Prague was amazing largely because of his great recommendations on our areas of interest: art, history, culture, music and food. Many of these we would not have known of through typical touristic sight-seeing. I would recommend people to stay at ARCO because of Guenther, he makes your Prague visit a better experience :) Just as seen on the photos of ARCO Guesthouse, the breakfast included pretty much everything to make a great start of the day, ranging from meat, cheeses, bread, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juices to home made jams! Guenther offered coffee/tea too :) The room: We stayed at Guesthouse Room 3. It was a quiet room, the bed was comfortable and we had very good sleep. The kettle and microwaves in the room were convenient. Bathroom was clean, shower is good, although you have to buy shampoo and gel yourself. There is a tram 22 stop within 2 minutes walk from the guesthouse, this tram takes you to old town and the Prague castle too (most sight-seeing places within 30 minutes). Two convenience stores close by (where you can buy tram tickets too). We also enjoyed a nice cafe down the street and a lovely vegan restaurant (Plevel) around the area. At night it felt very safe too, nice and quiet. Airport travelling: from the airport to the guesthouse was a pretty straight forward combination of tram, metro and bus (although the metro's do not have lifts, which can be slightly problematic for carrying heavy luggages up and down), totaling about 1 hour of travel time.","July 3, 2016","8    ARCO Guesthouse

507,It was a wonderful stay at ARCO guesthouse. Everything was exactly as described. Room was clean and was equipped with all amenities required. Location is just perfect with direct trams to the city center. Guenther was very helpful and kind. He even gave a small surprise as it was my birthday. The breakfast he laid out was awesome and he even arranged an early breakfast for us as we had to catch an early morning flight.

509,"While searching for a place to stay in Prague, the Czech Republic, we came across ARCO,it is located close to the tram and bus stop making it very easily accessible. It was within our budget and on reading the reviews and the description, what attracted us further was the information we could get on history & culture. ARCO accepted our reservation for 20th & 21st May, contact was established with Guenther. He is very prompt in responding and gives information on sights to see even in other cities,he guided us regarding intercity travel, very detailed guidelines on how to get to ARCO even suggesting sites we could look out for when travelling to ARCO. On our arrival, he was waiting outside the door of ARCO & had kept ready brochures & books on Prague for our reference. We booked half a day walking tour with him & my children found it most interesting & informative. He also buys tickets for local travel for guests if required and is always at hand in the morning to guide you about your travels during the day. He pays equal attention to all guests. We loved our stay in Prague mainly because of all the guidance he gave us.","May 26, 2016","8    ARCO Guesthouse

518,"I hate to disagree with the other visitor to ARCO. I found the hotel easy to find, with their online directions. It was also very convenient to the city sights. It is right on a tramline ( no. 23 ) it was a pleasant 20 minute ride to Prague Castle, and a ten minute trip to the center of town. Comparing this to an hour ride to reach downtown, on a bus that runs once an hour in my home town of St.Petersburg Florida, there is no comparison. The room I had was on the third floor of an apartment building two doors up the street. It was reached by a secure key operated elevator. It had a kitchenette, and a very nice private bathroom. Although it was still fairly cool outside, the room was warm and comfortable. The only problem I encountered was using the European style lock, which I was not familiar with. ( twice around to lock, and unlock ) The Hotel has an on site cafe with inexpensive internet access ( 40kc for 10 mins about $1.25 ) I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Prague.","July 29, 2005","8    ARCO Guesthouse

Staff was friendly, polite and helpful from receptionists, bartenders to cleaners.Everyone spoke good English. Breakfast was good, big variety of eggs, sausages vegetables, cheese, sweets etc. Although, the restaurant area seems small, there was always enough tables and big terrace, which is open till 10 pm.! Note: be ready to pay tourist tax (per day per person) and 50 euro deposit ! Location: 30-45 minutes, by taxi, from the airport.30 minutes away from city centre, by tram or buss5 minutes away from shopping centre and big food shop (Tesco Extra) which is open 24 hoursStadium 2 minutes away McDonalds ! Note: very loud and overcrowded if you are staying there during the football game. As they start to prepare stadium (soundcheck etc. ) at 8 in the morning. Supporters start coming in at 11 in the morning. And after the game majority goes to the hotel bar or just stand outside singing for another 2-4 hours.Transportation:We downloaded taxi app on our phone called ""Taxify"" (very similar to Uber) allows you to pay cash to driver or card online. From airport we paid around 550 Czech Koruna. From city centre around 200 Czech Koruna.Also they have bikes and scooters to rent all around town. You just need to download the app, attach your bank card and enjoy the ride. When you done, you just leave it anywhere on the street, make sure to check as in some areas it's restricted to leave them!Mostly we used tram, the stop is 3 minutes away from hotel and they go regularly. You can buy tickets at the reception and they will also give you map and will explain everything.

527,"Having read some excellent reviews from this site, we had booked this hotel after having a great time at Crowne plaza in Amsterdam. We arrived at the hotel on 25 May and to our shock we found out the hotel has been outsold and our guarenteed reservation is not guaranteed any more. We were transfered to another hotel in city which they claimed 4 star and we slept on a broken bed ( So much for * rating). The next day we arrived at Eden hotel again to secure our guarenteed room and we were promised for an upgrade and excellent spacious room. After all the promise we thought finally our vacation is going to go on a good note..Nope. This is where the horror starts. In the night the A/C stopped working and when we complained, the staffs said that they have no technician on board and he will come only on the morning and leave at 5 pm. And the wonderful manager of the hotel is having a good time at his home. The temperature was not cold though.it was literally hot and atleast we requested for a fan and all we got was "" Sorry u have to adjust until the technician comes tomorrow"". So much for a four star hotel. The next day we requested to speak to the manager and a guy spoke to us claiming to be a manager who was so rude. If he was the real manager , then I can understand the standard of the hotel. During our first day as a mode of compensation the staff told us that we can check out late at 2:00 PM. But on the last day the staff Anastasia was adamant that we leave at 1:00. We tried to explain to her that it was her staff that promised us a late check out but I think she was programmed by God to tell only one thing in her life "" U HAVE TO CHECK OUT NOW"". The only silver lining on this stay is the staff named NIKITA who understood our concerns and was providing us with support with a smile always.Atleast he was not programmed and was a human being. But NIKITA, this hotel does not deserve you. It's time you work in a real 4 Star hotel. Given by the positive reviews and my negative one, I can only conclude that the staff treat people differently based on the Color of our skin. If you are brown LOOK FOR ANOTHER HOTEL WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT and maybe that's what the hotel wants as well.","May 28, 2019","9    Iris Hotel Eden

546,"We stayed for 4 nights, upon arrival the receptionist only gave us a card key for one room (there were 3 of us), I informed her that I had booked 2 rooms and showed her the email confirmation however it took her some convincing that this was true..not sure how 3 of us were supposed to sleep in a twin room anyway, but that did not occur to her. The actual hotel was pleasant and in a convenient location, not too far from the centre and has a big shopping centre round the corner. The breakfast options were also pleasant. I was however disappointed with the cleaning of the rooms, on more than one occasion we came back to our rooms and found that the teas/coffees hadn't been replaced and the mugs were left dirty.. not impressed by that...Overall a reasonable stay","February 28, 2019","9    Iris Hotel Eden

Don't use taxi from hotel seems very expensive just jump on a bus / tram. Rooms are big enough all the same design as standard. No English channels of the tv. Good facilities, actual hot water etc. The only issue I had was when we went up to the room upon check in i noticed black marks and yellowish staining all over the sheet for our quilt. So on our way out I mentioned it to the receptionist. She offered me a new room to which I said no we don't need that just a new sheet please she said okay so I thought it would get changed. NOPE. 2 days we had the quilt for, we even left it out facing up so the cleaners would see it and change it but they didn't. I didn't get a picture of the quilt but I did notice the black stuff on the curtains as well.Other than that it was a good hotel I would come again.","January 11, 2019","9    Iris Hotel Eden

After researching, I had come down to two choices and I am glad I finally chose this one.We stayed at the luxury apartment.To begin with, the apartment was very clean. A fundamental necessity which is often overlooked by good category hotels in various destinations.The facilities are quite new, in very good condition and the essentials of good quality. The bed, for instance, was one of the best I have ever slept on.The heating was excellent with rather cold outside temperatures.The apartment is spacious and can easily accommodate three or even four persons. For two, it is ideal. We really appreciated the presence of two toilettes. While such a feature may not be necessary for most (ourselves included), we did find it quite convenient.There is plenty of natural light in daytime (at least in the mornings that we were there) and good lighting options in the apartment for the evening.The place was noiseless with a good sense of privacy.Overall, I can say that RR is value for money. I would gladly stay again on a future trip to Prague and would safely recommend this place to anyone I know.Thank you Alina for being so wonderful and for your good energy and thank you Marketa for arranging the surprise for my partner's birthday. Much appreciated.","January 20, 2019","10    Remember Residence

Upon in arriving in late November we were met with hot drinks cakes and biscuits. Our room had a bottle Proscecco, sweets and a hand written letter.The staff couldn't have been more polite, friendly and helpful. Remember Residence has a personal touch that I have never experienced in any hotel before. The whole place has a welcoming, comfortable feel. Its positive and well meaning welcome set me and my partner up to experience to beautiful city of Prague. I have never been to Prague before and I can't wait to get back there and one of those integral elements of that experience was this wonderful hotel. On our last day there we went out for the day we left our cases at the hotel to pick them up at the end of the day. At the end of that wonderful day there by our bags was a beautifully ornate cake, two bottles of water and another handwritten thank you note. A truly unforgettable place. Thank you Remember Residence a truly magical hotel. Book this place you won't regret it.","December 5, 2018","10    Remember Residence

593,"I cannot recommend this property enough for its location and services. I used the kitchen daily to prepare breakfast, which is the one American meal I miss most while abroad. The close proximity to public transportation, tourist sites, and shopping added to the property’s appeal. The residence is located about a 15-minute walk from The Charles Bridge, John Lenon Wall and a modern art museum. The light rail is just two blocks from the front door and 1-day or 3-day passes can be purchased at Andal station, which is about a 15-minute walk from the hotel (walk two blocks to light rail, turn left and walk several blocks until you see the Andal subway station on right side of street (tickets purchased inside at a kiosk or machines if you have exact change). The residence staff are friendly and as a gay couple, we were treated with dignity and respect. We were in Room 13 which was both extremely clean and quiet. The neighborhood is NOT over flowing with tourists unlike the rest of Prague. There are a number of ethnic restaurant choices in the neighborhood including a great café called Café Savoy where we had a traditional Czech meal. The restaurant at the Modern Art Museum offers a wonderful view of the river and Pilsner on tap – just sayin. If you want a refuge after a day of site seeing, this place is wonderful. You can be in the middle of all the action in under 10 minutes with the light rail. You will appreciate the location as much as the well-designed layout of the apartment.","October 26, 2018","10    Remember Residence

We are just leaving our first trip to Prague now and I would never consider another hotel for our second trip. The residence is small and intimate, it has a very friendly and knowledgeable staff, and it is immaculately clean. The rooms are very large with amenities that are hard to beat. The location is perfect it’s in a quieter part of town but all the tourist heavy areas are very easily accessible. It has all the convenience of an amazing location without the tourist feel. I wouldn’t consider anywhere else. It was a wonderful long weekend in Prague and we can’t wait to come back! Thank you so much to the Remember Residence team for making it extra magical.

The interiors have excellent design and are so well thought out, clearly with the guests needs the main concern. There are lots of little touches that make the guest experience special like the complimentary items in the apartment and giving us free bottles of water for our onwards train journey. Secondly, the staff were brilliant! The two staff members that we interacted with spoke perfect English and could not have been more kind and helpful, providing recommendations for dining, ordering us taxis and providing directions. Lastly, the location is perfect for exploring Prague, a short walk from the Charles Bridge and many other attractions.

They gave excellent advice on where to exchange money, buy groceries and restaurant choices. The location was great and old town was within walking distance. The Valtavo River is just two-block away and the scenery and we enjoyed the walk to the Old Town. The room was spotless and exceptionally clean. Our kids enjoyed sitting on the hammock. It was very spacious by European standard. We got take-out from the restaurant next door and the food was delicious. It's so convenient to just get take-out at the end of the days where everyone was tired.

599,"This accommodation is charming and spacious. We were greeted upon arrival by a very handsome gentleman who was extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations during our stay. He also gave us a visitor map and highlighted the main tourist sites such as the Prague Castle. The rooms are actually small apartments with kitchens and dining tables. The bed is so comfortable due to a memory foam mattress. The only complaints I would have about the room are as follows: no body lotion or hair conditioner in the toiletries, the bathroom has one toilet and a boudet but the boudet smelled of urine during our whole stay no matter how long I ran the bathroom fan or ran water in the boudet. There was free water, coffee, biscuits & ice cream offered for the duration of each guests stay. We were also greeted with a small welcome bottle of champagne. The hotel has very good security and is located within one block of the river. There is also a super cute cat cage next door. The staff were always helpful with ordering taxis or making reservations for activities such as the beer spa, which was super fun and unique. The location of the accommodation is in an area that I found not to be the best for accessibility. I had to walk across the bridge and into the old town for night life and dinners. I had quite a lot of problems with taxis trying to scam me on my way to the hotel from other parts of town but obviously this is no fault of the hotel. I think this hotel is a great location for families. It is quiet in the evenings and felt very safe. The price of the accommodation is extremely reasonable and I had the best sleep in the accommodation. ","August 19, 2018","10    Remember Residence

We came here for two nights as part of my boyfriends 21st birthday present. I spoke to the staff via email before we arrived asking if they could possibly decorate the room with balloons, they did this and more! They left balloons, banners, wine and even a cake! The hotel arranged for us to be picked up from the airport and we were greeted with a sign with my name and driven to the hotel, which is good because I have no sense of direction. The drive didn’t cost too much either. Once we got to the hotel a lovely lady gave us maps and showed us what we should go and see whilst we’re here and showed us to our room. She was a great help and I advise everyone to go and see Prague Castle!The room I booked was the deluxe room and even though I saw pictures online I didn’t expect it to be so nice! We had a lovely view from the windows and the room was huge, set out over two floors. The hammock was a nice touch although me and my boyfriend always tried to fight over it as it was surprisingly comfy. The room included everything you needed and even had two bathrooms, two double beds and a single bed and a kitchen with a dining table. Overall, the best stay at a hotel ever!

Walk towards tram 20 then alight at svandovo divadlo. From there you can walk towards the apartment around 3-5 mins walk. Kudos to the Receptionist who check us in. She’s very friendly and accommodating, Plus can speak really good English. I think the only thing that can be improve is the housekeeping, they don’t normally refill the body wash and shampoo so we had to call the reception to replace the toiletries.

626,"We stayed in one of comfort apartments with my husband for one night. A modern apartment in a historical building - they have done a very good job renovating it - everything is finished to a high standard. The room was spotless, and the cleaning lady was extremely friendly - and so was the office staff, they were welcoming and happy to help. It was very easy to get there from the airport and the location is great, we didn't need to take any public transport to walk around the center of Prague. The kitchen has everything you could possibly need on a holiday - fridge, microwave, kettle, small hob etc. Good WIFI, comfy bed and good bedding,, safe, good hair drier, very good shower, toilet and bidet.. we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend Remember Residence to our friends.","September 24, 2016","10    Remember Residence

Hotel Hermes is situated in a nice suburb to Prague, and 10 minutes on the tube, yellow line, will take you to city center. The rooms are very comfortable, light and practical and breakfast is good; exactly what you need without excesses.

It's in the suburbs but It's well connected to the city center because the nearest metro station is just 50 meters away and it takes just 10 mins to the central metro station. Nice breakfasts. Rooms well cleaned. Kind staff members. Negative points: - the wifi doesn't work so well in the rooms; - the only thing that covers the window during the night is a small curtain so you're obliged to wake up early; - no way of getting a decent Italian coffe at breakfast (this is not a good reason to complain about, I know!)","August 20, 2017","11    Herrmes

646,"We arrived to the hotel to be told that there had been a water incident in Prague 5 and the water had been shut off until the morning. We were a little disappointed by this as we'd have liked showers after a long day, but we understood this wasn't their fault. The hotel staff did a wonderful job of keeping us well supplied with water bottles and buckets of water to wash with until the morning. The rooms are bright, clean and spacious. The only downside is the blinds which let quite a bit of light in in the morning. There is wifi in the rooms as well as a tv, electronic safe and a decent sized bathroom. Location isn't a problem. I had read that the hotel was difficult to find which I disagree with as our taxi driver found it no problem and it's 5 minutes from the metro station. It's 30mins from the airport which is incredibly easy to get to and from using the metro and a bus. To get to the centre of Prague from this hotel, it takes approx 15 minutes on the metro which you'll find just around the corner. Metro tickets that last 30 minutes can be purchased from the hotel, these cost 24Czk (less than a £1). The ticket machines at the station offer tickets for different lengths of time but I'd advise buying a ticket from the hotel if you don't have any coins as the ticket machines don't accept notes. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and answered every question we had. I was amazed to find that even after we finally left our room for the day after a heavy night out, our room had been made which we weren't expecting considering we'd left late in the day. Overall, this is a wonderful hotel with brilliant staff, we would definitely return here and I highly recommend it to anyone.","August 16, 2016","11    Herrmes

Direct connection from Florence train station where our bus landed.However the hotel is a bit hidden behind the greenery, and we would never have found it in the dark had the staff not come to show us the way- the hotel should put up a sign board facing the station!The staff was wonderful, very helpful and courteous. They didn't have tea/ coffee kettles during our stay but offered to make our tea and heat our food in their microwave oven, any time of the night or day. We also used the hotel to exchange our Euros- I only wish they had also agreed to buy back our Czec Kroners!Wi fi was a bit weak, phone didn't catch signal in the room. We had to come close to the reception for using wifi on the phone every time, which was not very convenient.Breakfast was decent and served in a very pleasant, green ambience , but there was no variety from day to day, not even eggs made to order.Over all a very pleasant stay.

The location is quiet, which is nice and much needed after spending hours in the busy city centre. Breakfast is lovely as well, plenty of choice, all very tasty and fresh. Overall - highly recommend! Minor issues, however, this is why I did not give the hotel 5 stars. Things for the hotel to consider: -there are no kettles in the rooms. I can live without a free coffee, not a problem, but no hot water in winter months is inconvenient-the blinds are very thin - not for people who are used to sleeping in the darkness. Fine with me, but not for everyone.-no additional pillows in the rooms - I find this unusual, I've always had extra pillows in 3* hotels around the world -restaurant - there is no space for dirty dishes. Tables are not big enough to store them if someone uses more than one plate or e.g.: has cereals and then a sandwich. It would be useful to have a table on the side to enable your guests to remove them or alternatively have waiters who remove them.- it gets too hot in the rooms. We had a radiator off and kept the window was open regularly too and despite that it was hot in the room all the time. Not sure how this is possible. It's great that the hotel is warm in winter, but too warm is no longer pleasant. I don't want this to come across as picky or demanding, I just think these are simple and cheap improvements you could introduce for your guests. Otherwise - brilliant place and service, I would stay again.","December 29, 2015","11    Herrmes

It took me 1 minute to walk to the metro stop and trains were every 5-7 minutes. It takes around 15-20 minutes to get to the old town.Breakfast was great, Alot of choice and alot of seating area.If I return to prague I will return to this hotel. I paid £50 per night for 2 people inc breakfast","June 3, 2014","11    Herrmes

668,"I stayed here in early May for two nights, with my clients- We had booked three double rooms.The positives - the place is very new with a modern decor. The rooms are clean. There is plenty of secure parking for guests. The breakfast is very basic, but hearty.Unlike some other reviewers, we had very cooperative staff - they helped us with maps, made a few calls for us (to inquire about parking situation in the city) and so on. But again, service depends on who is across the counter, and maybe we were lucky to have very helpful staff.The downside - Location! This place is quite far from the city. We explored the option of taking public transport, but quickly gave up and drove instead and parked in a city garage. if there are senior citizens or children in the group, I would not recommend this place. The other drawback because of the location is that there are no restaurants in the vicinity and the hotel does not have one either. So make sure you have your dinner outside before heading back to the hotel, or be ready to drive a few kilometers (again toward the city) for dinner.Also, approaching the hotel from the city side, our GPS always got confused in the last half a kilometer (maybe because some of the new roads are not mapped). Approaching it from Plzen side (where we came in from), there was no problem. Something to keep in mind.So, on the whole a nice place to stay if you have a car and if you are okay driving into Prague each day and parking somewhere close to city centre.","May 22, 2014","11    Herrmes

It is also in an area popular with expats for similar reasons.For the tourist I would recommend it as well. A cheap ticket gets you quickly from the airport (bus 100 to ZLIČÍN then 6 stops on metro) and its quick by Metro into town or for those in the know down to Smíchov for local life.","January 5, 2014","11    Herrmes

672,"I went on a business trip to Prague and had no idea where to stay. I checked Trip Advisor and after looking at a number of properties, I selected Hotel Herrmes. When the cab brought me from the airport to the hotel, I started thinking, ""What in the heck have I done."" We seemed to be in an industrial area and we definitely weren't in the town center. Once I was dropped off, the hotel looked new and almost out of place for the neighborhood. The staff was very pleasant. One of the first things I noticed as I checked was an award from Trip Advisor for one of the best budget hotels in Prague. It definitely was. The room and bed were comfortable and the complementary breakfast was excellent. Great value! Yes, it was a distance from the city center but there is a metro (subway) station literally 300 yards from the hotel. Four to five stops and you are in Prague center. I would definitely stay there again.","December 27, 2013","11    Herrmes

676,"Stayed one night in this hotel during a business trip. My trip took longer and I needed to stay one more night - unfortunately the hotel was already fully booked otherwise I would go back there. The hotel is new, very clean, all people I met at the reception were friendly and helpful. Did not use the secure parking at rear as there were parking places on the street also secured by a camera. Room was of decent size, bathroom great, however the beds were extremely soft. In the room there is only wired interned, wi-fi should be available in the lobby (did not use it). However the speed of the wired interned was quite slow. Good breakfast. Although I did not use it the hotel is literally next to a metro station (3 min. walk max) so it is convenient. On the other hand it faces either a busy street (especially in the morning) or the abandoned industrial building with a railway track that is still operating. I was waken twice at night by a really loud shunting train.","September 13, 2013","11    Herrmes

678,"The hotel looks like its brand new, very modern and stylish. The free and secured car park is perfect. It even has a roof. Staff is very nice. The mark for you the best spots to visit on a city map and sell you the subway tickets. The quick ride with the subway is really the best option to explore the city. It's literally 1 minute walk from the hotel and very nice and clean. Breakfast is also quite decent and very large selection for the price. The only thing to consider is that you occasionally hear the airplanes in the morning and evening which can be quite loud for a minute there. Didn't bother me. Also worth noting is that the rooms only have wired internet. It's free and the cable is provided, but if you want to surf via tablet or mobile phone you have to come to the lobby to use the free wifi there. There are plenty of comfy couches and a TV so many guests hang out here to check their mails. All in all a top hotel. Next time I'm in Prague I'll stay here again.","August 8, 2013","11    Herrmes

For what you pay, it is a good value. Breakfast is generous and convenient. The only issue I had was payment, as I had prepaid online for my stay and the person at the service desk could not locate the proof of payment. This unfortunately delayed my plans for the day and I ended up missing part of a tour I had booked, spending extra money to book a taxi and make phone calls so I could reach my group. I do not mention this to complain as we eventually got it sorted (I persisted and proof of payment was indeed found), but rather as a reminder to be vigilant and make sure you have all your ducks in a row before you go and to double check all plans the day before so your schedule is not interrupted.

Located in a nice part of town just south of Charles Bridge (10 min walk) it’s off the main road and very quiet. Lovely staff who were very friendly at check in and very helpful again at check out. Breakfast is ample and exactly what I’d expect for this price range. Lots of choice and I found it all to be of a good standard. The room was very clean and had everything you could need. Location wise it’s a short walk to all the popular destinations in Prague but allows you to just be out of the centre of it all if you want a quieter location. I look forward to coming back in the future. Thank you.","June 9, 2019","12    Hotel Mala Strana

698,"Hotel Mala Strana is the only place I want to stay in Prague. I've stayed here many times over the last 15 years, sometimes once, but often twice a year. The location is perfect, central, but in a quiet, peaceful road - it's close to all of the main sights Prague has to offer, which are easily walkable from the hotel. Located on the Historic Mala Strana side of the river. If you need public transport, there's a tram stop at the end of the road which will give you access to Prague's excellent public transport system.The rooms are a good size, very comfortable and most importantly, they're spotlessly clean. The beds are very comfortable, which combined with the quiet location means I never have trouble getting a good night's sleep. The building is quite old, and retains many of it's interesting, original features. In recent years, it has been sympathetically refurbished to provide modern facilities - but it hasn't lost any of it's charm. The décor is tasteful and suits the building. There's a lift to all floors.One of the most important features of any hotel stay is the breakfast, and breakfasts here won't disappoint. There is a huge variety of hot and cold foods to suit all tastes from the buffet, whether you want continental or something hot. Too many choices to list here, all I need to say is that a Hotel Mala Strana breakfast really sets you up for the day. I often skip lunch!I can't fault Hotel Mala Strana and have been very happy during my visits here over the years. Everyone who works here, whether management, restaurant staff, receptionists or housekeeping really puts a lot of effort into making everyone's stay an enjoyable and pleasurable one. It is credit to them that the hotel is so good - and also means that I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Prague.

711,"After using the card to open your room door, there is nothing modern or functional inside. The hair dryer only works for about twenty seconds at a time, The room layout is clumsy, with the bathroom door opening into the path of everything. There is no air conditioning, and no screens on the windows, so good luck in the spring. Heating is by radiator, so there wont be much control of it in winter. The website didn’t mention the fridge, and although it is very small, it is useful. I didn’t understand the kettle and plates, as there is no microwave or other way to heat food. The bathroom fan sounds like its a jet engine reving to take off. The squeak in the door is fodder for a horror movie. The stairs are in desperate need of cleaning. Breakfast isn’t until 7:30, The room safe uses a medieval warded key, for which there is a 500 kc deposit.

There are numerous restaurants near to the hotel, our favourite was The Olympia just as you come off the bridge, a buzzing atmosphere and good food.

Crockery and cutlery were also provided so we could eat in the room but no pans or utensils to warm food on the hotplate. We found the beds to be very comfortable and rooms were cleaned daily. The room however gets hot, especially since it was peak summer and the table fans provided were not sufficient for cooling. While I understand they cannot install ACs due to UNESCO regulations, providing ceiling fans, larger pedestal fans or room coolers would have been more helpful, especially in summer. Toilets were clean and hot and cold water was perfect. Plenty of towels were provided and changed regularly, but no other toiletries except for liquid soap.

People will feel the warmth.Only our corridor was dark due to light failure which took 2-3 days for them to repair, I expect this delay was not intentional and not regular The nearest tram stop is just around 180-meter walk which will take you to all major attractions within 10-15 min. People can walk also if they have the time and energy. Number of food shops and supermarkets are nearby to fulfill the regular needs.The hotel place is centrally located yet just bit away from the hassles and bustles of city.

723,"Great location and great hotel. It's at a walking distance from the old city centre and the castle so we basically didn't need to use public transportation. The room was big, we had an entrance hall and a sofa and clean. They were cleaning it every day and changing the towels when needed. The bathroom was fine. They have a hair dryer that was working well (normally the ones at hotels have very little power) and the water pressure of the shower was excellent! The breakfast was tasty and it had a variety and the staff was always smiling and helpful. They also sell public transportation tickets without overcharging so I suggest to buy it from there since they don't sell them on the buses. I recommend it.On the bad side we asked for a double bed and we were given a room with two single ones which had wheels so even if they were put together by the staff during night they were drawn apart creating space between the beds. Also the pillows were extremely soft and it could use a renovation.","January 25, 2018","12    Hotel Mala Strana

Rooms are comfortable and well equipped, if a little tired. Wi-Fi is excellent in the rooms. The breakfasts are tasty, plentiful and have a large choice of warm and cold items. The 2 best things are the value for money and the friendliness of the staff (this time the kitchen staff were particularly friendly and helpful). The blip - on our third morning the 6 of us were going back to our rooms in the lift when it broke down. An engineer was called and we were rescued within 30 minutes. This I can totally accept, accidents can happen. What was not acceptable was the reaction of the management/staff at that particular time. It took over 5 minutes of ringing the alarm for anyone to try to speak to us. The only question was how many people were in the lift, there were 6 of us and the response was that there should only be 4 of us max. Before, during and after the incident the plaque in the lift states maximum 6 persons! When freed there was no member of staff around to apologies or the check everyone was OK. It was like the incident never happened, it was never mentioned over our last 2 days.This one incident does not detract from the quality and value of the hotel and we will definitely stay here again when next in Prague.","November 27, 2017","12    Hotel Mala Strana

The hotel is situated a 10 minute walk from Wencelas square and so is ideal to retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. We had a slight issue with the electricity on arrival, but that was resolved soon enough and 2 bottles of complimentary water greeted me and room mate. Thr hotel is very clean and the beds comfortable. The rooms do have a fridge and small, concealed kitchenette, but there were no glasses, mugs etc. Breakfast was more aligned to a local/European taste, with no bacon and small local sausages, potatoes dishes, scrambled eggs and of course, cold meats and cheese, but there was a fruit juice machine and tea/coffee. Staff were helpful and friendly and in all, for the price we paid (around £120 for 4 nights) you cannot grumble. I would not hesitate in returning to this hotel and if you have a wander, there is a pun a few streets away where beet was 76p a pint!

We very much enjoyed our stay, breakfast is included in buffet style with a variety of foods and drinks amongst them coffee, tea, milk and juices as well as cakes, breads, salads and eggs and sausages. Free wifi worked fabulously to look up information to get around Prague and such. The doubles are quite charming and fairly recently redecorated. Beds are solid and compfy. The rooms also include a small kitchenette and fridge, which we didn't use in the end. The bathroom hasn't lost its more antique charme yet though also offers a few things to mark. The shower could not be positioned to keep it's place while water was running and holding it in your hands was the final and only option. Cleaniness was good though not perfect, once again our bathroom had a few stains on the shower curtain and remaining hair on the tiles from previous guests or the house maid I assume. Besides that it was spotless! My family's rooms were almost identical, no complaints about their showers or cleaniness though. The two bedroom place on the top floor however had a new and fully redone, modern bathroom. It offered accomodation for 4-5people. The hotel is nicely situated within walking distance from the tram, 25min walking distamce from the main station and about 15-20min to the Charles Bridge and other sights.

A nice feature that allowed us to bring leftovers back to our room from dinner.

They even recommended tours, restaurants and local grocery stores. As there are three of us traveling they gave us a larger room with kitchen (stove, sink, fridge/freezer, cutlery, cups and plates), lounge room (with proper single bed) , bathroom and a seperate bedroom. Breakfast was a buffet including cereal, juices, coffee, tea, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, fruit salad and more, so very surprised to see negative reviews on breakfast. (It's a three star hotel, so wasn't expecting 5 star food) Comfortable beds, clean rooms, clean bathroom. It's an older hotel so once again was not expecting fancy decor and finishes, especially not for how cheap the accommodation was.As for the location, I chose it specifically as I had travelled to Prague before and wanted to be close enough to walk to all the main attractions, but to also be far enough away from the crowds. This hotel suits those needs perfectly. Room is a bit warm with no aircon, but is beautiful to sleep with windows open. Did not have any bugs or mosquitoes.  This place is perfect for those that want to be close to most major sites and slightly away from the massive crowds to be expected in Prague and also want to pay a reasonable price for a room you won't be spending too much time in anyways!","August 23, 2015","12    Hotel Mala Strana

The hotel is in a good location in Prague 5, nice area with the massive Novy shopping centre only a 15 min walk away and the tram stop a 1 min walk away. There are also supermarkets, pubs and restuarants within an 2 min walk of the hotel however there is no noise whatsoever at night. Old Town and Prague 1 is a short 20 min walk away and a taxi into Old Town (where most of the clubs are) only costs 180 Kuronas - dont get a taxi through the hotel as they charge 400 Kuronas which is a rip off. Overall the hotel suite is pretty nice. Very clean and housekeeping is daily. the breakfast is pretty naff - only the basics i.e. toast, basic cereal, terrible coffee etc and after the first day, we didnt bother waking up for breakfast again.Hotel staff are friendly and welcoming and if i visited prague again, i would definetly consider staying at this hotel as its value for money and in an ideal location.","June 22, 2015","12    Hotel Mala Strana

The staff helped us book tours and a car rental and did so with a smile. The reading/sitting room is quiet lovely...situated in a small courtyard surrounded by some greenery. I have seen comments about the breakfast being poor and our breakfast experiences have been great. Each morning has had a selection of different meats and hot food along with cold items. We went later in the morning one day and still had a complete selection of food. If you want to use the kitchenette you can rent pots/ pans etc....just ask reception. Some of the hotels on our trip have been extremely small so I appreciate the large living area with this hotel. The location is great....quiet street within walking distance of Charles bridge. It is a bit of a jaunt to Old Towne Square but you are close to the Trams so it is still easily accessible. There are many restaurants and bars in the area.

769,"Just visited Prague for a few days and stayed here for 3 nights (3rd – 6th May). Always do my research on Trip Advisor after filtering available hotels prior to booking, and decided to book this hotel. We had a few surprises when we arrived at our designated room though. We arrived fairly late in the evening and were allocated Room #1. I booked a Junior Suite, and according to the confirmation this comprised of 1 double and 1 single bed. However what we got was 2 single beds squashed together, with 2 single mattresses and 2 single duvet covers. I complained to reception, and after they checked our room they confirmed all the rooms in their hotel were like this. So basically it was not their fault, but the error of the site I booked with (Expedia). We had no choice to accept it really, but I will be taking this up with Expedia. In addition to the bed situation, we were supposed to have a bath in our en-suite, but I wouldn’t have called it a bath. More like a large sit down shower tray thing. Not enough room to stretch out and certainly not possible to lie down. Oh and then there was no plug anyway, so we had to take showers. Not ideal when you’ve pounded the streets of Prague all day. As for the buffet breakfast, this was ok, albeit the water to make your tea wasn’t hot water. The bonus though was there were scrambled eggs on offer, not expected but appreciated. We were glad we didn’t arrange a trip here in June or July though, especially being allocated Room #1. This room was downstairs from reception, which should have been a cooler room really? Oh not so. It was very warm during the night, and this was at the beginning of May. We both had terrible nights, as it was too stuffy. No air-con in the room, although I guess we should have asked for a fan. We have no idea if any other rooms had air-con. The only solace was to open all the windows to let some fresh air in. The downside to this was the communal smoking area outside our room so there was chatting right outside late evening and early morning, and we had to keep the curtains closed to stop any prying eyes. The bed was hard, the room safe was right at the bottom of the wardrobe so you had to get on your hands and knees to access it, there was a kettle in the room, and cups, glasses & cutlery. But no condiments. The hotel offered free wi-fi, but this was so hap-hazard and came in and out on regular occasions. There was a small fridge in the room which helped to keep water cold which was great. The location of the hotel was good for the tram route into the centre of town. And there is a great bar/restaurant just 1 minute walk around the corner called Meduzzy which is open until 11pm. On check out, the staff did not ask if we had enjoyed our stay, it was a good job really! Other travellers have commented that this is a clean and tidy hotel. It was indeed a clean & tidy hotel. It was just the little issues we had that stopped us enjoying staying there.","May 7, 2015","12    Hotel Mala Strana

770,"We spent three nights in this hotel sited in a good location opposite side of the river to the main attractions of Prague. All within walking distance and not far from the famous Charles Bridge. There were plenty of really good restaurants nearby which were much cheaper than those in the centre. Also close by was the funicular railway which led to a lovely park and viewing point over the river and all of Prague. Spectacular!We booked a suite which could only be loosely described a suite!! It was a bedroom which had two half dividing walls separating the kitchen area from the bed! That said, it was basic but clean and adequate to our needs. There were no toiletries supplied nor were there tea and coffee provided. I am not sure why they had a kitchen area as there was a cooking hob but no pans! It would have been better if they had left it just as a large room!! The staff were courteous and helpful but the breakfast room was two floors down from the ground floor and was dingy and canteen like. The breakfast was 'different' to say the least. Nice fresh bread and a small choice of cooked meats and cheeses. Also some kind of 'omelette', small hot dog type sausages and scrambled egg. However, if anything ran out there was no chance of replacement!! If you waited until late to breakfast there was very little left!The best that could be said of this hotel was that it was clean, free wifi and the location good","April 25, 2015","12    Hotel Mala Strana

771,"We absolutely recommend staying here. This Guesthouse is in a beautiful, residential neighbourhood. It is very quiet and peaceful and it's nice to come home to after a busy day. Although it was in a residential neighbourhood, it was very easy to get to the city centre and to all the sights. It was a 15 minute tram ride or a 10 minute subway ride. And it was only a 5-10 minute minute walk to the tram or subway. There was a grocery store and some really nice restaurants nearby which made things convenient if we wanted to stay in the neighbour hood for a bit. There is also the beautiful 'Visheryad Palace' which you can walk to from the Guesthouse. The Guesthouse was neat and clean and our room was cleaned every day by a cleaning lady. Every morning there was an amazing breakfast ready for us including bread, cereal, fresh cold cuts, cheese, jam, yoghurt, fruit and danish. The hosts, Jan, Jitka, Jiri and Jana were very helpful and kind and made us feel welcome. They were more than willing to help. We saw Jan most of the time during our stay. He picked us up from the airport and helped carry our luggage to our room. Every morning he gave us tips on how to get to sights, what to see and where to eat (and what to avoid!!!!). Jan was very enthusiastic and passionate and gave us excellent recommendations. There was even a transit ticket available for us that we could use for our stay there.

It's a little outside the center of town but that is a great positive after a long day in the crowded touristic areas. The neighborhood is quiet and leafy (although it is a bit of a schlep to the tram and the metro -- there's a small hill -- it's very doable and still very convenient, and the proprietors are very ready to help with directions, passes and so forth. Better yet, there are a few terrific restaurants in the neighborhood if you want to relax away from the crowds. The proprietors, two brothers and their wives, are extremely friendly and helpful. For example, when our flight was delayed, even though it was very late, Jan was nevertheless right there to transport us from the airport and offered to drive us via the ""scenic route,"" which was longer but allowed us to see a little of the city on the way. They are obviously (and rightly) proud of their city and enjoy sharing it with guests. While there are few ""frills,"" the facilities, rooms, hot water, bathrooms, towels, sheets, etc. are ample and spotlessly clean and functional. Breakfast, too, was simple but ample and very tasty.

778,"I made my reservation on booking.com some time ago (New Years Eve 2016). However. It disapeared and i couldn't find it again to make proper recommendation. It bothered me for some time so i need to say more about this place. First of all Jiri - owner of this place is very much humble and open minded person. He is also a walking knowledge repository about Prague and Czech republic. He will tell you everything and recommend great places to see during your short or long stay in Prague. Place itself is very well maintained. Rooms are comfy and clean. Breakfasts are just super tasty. You can take whatever you want from the fridge, make a note and pay on your check-out. Super cool sign of trust to the guests. Place is located in a quiet neighbourhood in short distance to a metro station. It is very easy to get to the old town from there in a very short time. Generally we've had only great memories about this place. I fully recommend it to everybody !","September 28, 2017","13    Lida Guest House

It is not the most luxurious or the most up-to-date, but it is delightful and a taste of a Prague community. The breakfasts were delicious. Jan was very helpful to suggest places for us to visit in Prague and purchased tickets for events as well as got us to the airport for our return flight to the states. Lida Guest House is named after Jan's mother, and he treats his B&B and his guests in a way that would make his mother proud.

785,"Stayed here for 3 nights and it was wonderful. The proprietors make go to great lengths to ensure that the spirit of Prague remains while you recover from sight-seeing, eating or other activities. Single rooms available or you can group up a 3-person room. The beds are supremely comfortable with large pillows and soft, warm comforters. The Lida trades the convenience of being close to the city for the quiet serenity that refreshes the soul. It is within a short walk of a subway stop, making downtown just an 8 minute ride. Breakfast each morning is a delightful array of bread, cheese, prosciutto alongside breakfast cereals. I'd highly recommend this place to any who wish to exhaust their bodies in the city and have it completely recharged by morning (or afternoon if you are a midnight wanderer). Simply put, I will stay here again the next time I am in Prague. ","January 15, 2017","13    Lida Guest House

Our room did not yet have a shower but this will be subject for a later renovation we have understood.The hosts could not have been more friendlier and responded to every question we had. For a reasonable charge they also offer an airport pick-up and/or drop-off service. The breakfast offered was a good start of the day.The villa is a bit outside of the city center but the excellent public transportation services will bring you to the city center within half an hour including the short walk downhill to the tram stop or uphill to the metro station. A bus stop is also close to the guest house.The hosts also recommended a few restaurants in the neighbourhood and we were not disappointed. In fact, the area is much cheaper than the city center and you get very much value for your money.We would recommend Lida BB to anyone who is looking for a charming stay in Prague.

One of the innkeepers, Jan, picked us up at the airport for a small extra fee, which was very convenient. He was a wealth of knowledge about Prague during our stay! He helped us book bus tickets for another part of our trip, offered us Prague transportation passes at a discounted rate and shared with us helpful tips on local restaurants. I also loved this location. Prague can feel very busy and crowded in Sept. and it was so relaxing to come back to this inn in a very local neighborhood that was 15 min or so by tram from Old Town. It was a 5 min walk to the tram stop so it was easy to get into town. There is also a metro station that is a 10 min. walk. Our room was spacious and we had a delicious breakfast every morning.

793,"We had a two-night visit in Prague and to be fair, staying in Lida Guest House made it certainly degree ir two more enjoyable.The exchange of emails after reservation was fluent and natural and the follow-up right before our trip was pleasant. We took the pick-up service from the airport offered by the guest house and it proved to be worth every penny as the trip was easy, but also Jan, one of the business owners, picked us up and gave us a small trip showing us places right from the start wraped with a lot of knowledge about Prague.We got our room straight ob the arrival followed by a package of information about moving around and points of interest worth visiting from Jan. They have a selection of public transportation tickets on sale at the guest house and promise to do reservations for teather and concert tickets and to restaurants, a service we did not end up using. It is easy to ask advice concerning moving and for example suggestions for good restaurants and information is actively offered. They all seem very enthusiastic about heloing their guests to enjoy Prague and esoecially Jans knowledge of the city seemed astonishingly vast.The room, three bed room we had at least, was nice and peaceful. The breakfast was basic but suprisingly wide-ranging. Only downside might be the distance as the guest house is certainly a bit off from the main sights but I personally did not mind as the trams and the metro were only a short walk away. This is something to concider in any case, especially if one has an intention staying long in the city center, although information on the night buses and trams was available from the guest house.All in all, I am very happy I chose to stay at Lida and certainly will concider coming again should (or when, more likely) I visit Prague again.","September 12, 2016","13    Lida Guest House

Jan was extremely helpful in answering my questions and locating all of the places I wanted to visit (some of which were pretty obscure!). The room was absolutely spotless and a good size (I took the small double/large single...not the smallest but the next one up). Very comfortable bed and the neighborhood very quiet, so I had a GREAT night's sleep.The bathroom was very modern and had a great shower. Hairdryer provided and some toiletries. The breakfast was quite abundant, plenty of good hot coffee, plus a range of breads, yogurt, cereal, fruit, meats and cheeses, and some juice. Setting nice, plenty of light and comfortably arranged. You could sit and not talk to anyone if you wanted, or you could chat with other guests.There is a small reading room that I didn't use, but I looked and saw there were some books available to read (a bunch in English); there is a computer available there for the rare person who doesn't have their own device!The location for me was good. If you want to be right in the middle of the noise and crowds of, say, the Old Town Square, then this isn't there. But it was literally a five minute walk from the metro and maybe 5-6 minutes down to the river where the trams passed (frequently). The river is a good spot for a morning (or any time of day) run if you like to keep up on your workouts while traveling.I was sorry not to stay longer; I was literally there less than 24 hours, but I will definitely return there next time.Great service for an unbeatable price!","July 17, 2016","13    Lida Guest House

Jan met us at the train station and after 5 days took us to the airport. After dropping us off at the airport, I realized that I had left our passports hanging in a vest in the wardrobe. In a panic, I called Jitka and she told me that Jan did not have a cell phone but she would leave a message for him as she had a doctor's appointment and would be gone before he arrived back at the Lida. A few minutes later she called back and said Jan was on his way back to the airport. He had to have drive crazily back to the airport to give us our passports. We boarded the airplane with less than minutes left in the boarding process. Later, in talking with Jitka, we learned that she was very late in going to her doctor's appointment because she waited for Jan to return in order to send him back to the airport.

The subway is close as well and serves as an alternative. We liked the streetcar as one sees more of the city that way.Daily breakfast is simply a delight, which is augmented by the meeting of other guests from around the world.The owners are also very helpful in telling you about ""must see attractions"", depending on how much time you have in the city.The room we occupied was very quiet and comfortable.What else can we say about this place and its owners?

We stayed in the attic apartment which can accommodate six people (maybe more?) and I don't think is available through booking.com. As per their service standard, I was greeted on arrival, assisted to the room and offered coffee/tea to discuss Prague. Jan and Jiri are very knowledgeable on events in the town and how to get the most out of your trip. They have public transportation tickets available and can explain how to use it.If there is a negative aspect to the stay, the area near Lida is a little run-down. It is really typical for the area, but can look a little intimidating if you aren't expecting it. Again, this is my third stay and each time I have been out late at night and have never had even the slightest uneasy feeling about my surroundings.A couple of quick tidbits- free wifi; they serve breakfast; it is a ten minute walk to three different train/tram stops; more reading material than you can read on the city; secure parking available on request (small fee); if you're up for a long walk, it is walking distance to the city center (done it a few times with kids, about 40 minutes).

This small family run hotel offered us very good accommodation for a very reasonable price. Owners are very nice people always willing to help.

812,"This was our first visit to Prague, and the city was everything we had heard it was. Beautiful with a really great energy. The buildings have interesting detail and the city just seeps with history. My husband, 15 year old daughter, 3 year old and I stayed at the Lida Guest house in the family suite- which was more than enough room for us. There was a queen size bed in the large room and two bedrooms that both slept two people. One had a double bed, the other had two single beds. There was also a little loft space that would be perfect for two little kids, probably aged 5-10 or so. It was like a secret hideout! My 3 year old liked going up there to check it out. There was a kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home! It was absolutely perfect to come home to at night after a day exploring Prague. The breakfast was fantastic, the coffee wonderful, the hosts were so very nice and helpful with recommendations. Jiri referred us to an authentic Czech eatery and we absolutely loved it. Pinta, it was called. We had such a great stay in such a gorgeous city. And a huge thank you to our hosts at Lida guest house! We hope to see you again! ","July 13, 2015","13    Lida Guest House

He took time to explain where to go and what it see. He had metro transportation tickets available for us to buy.My wife is celiac and needs gluten free food. We mentioned this to Jiri and he had a gluten free loaf of bread for my wife at breakfast time.The door handle on the bathroom door broke off. I shown this to Jiri and he had it fixed when we came back in the evening.Lida has a PC available for use in its own separate room. Our bedroom had a fantastic view overlooking Prague.

Good breakfast, clean and comfortable beds. Short walk up slight hill to underground, slightly further and steeper down to buses. Old Town is walkable for the energetic.

815,"Just returned from a month-long vacation in Europe and Lida Guest House was our first stop (4/27 to 5/2/15). I exchanged emails with Jitka and Jan prior to our arrival and my request for given an unit with views was quickly granted. Very pleasant communications!On our way to Prague on 4/27, we missed our connecting flight from Frankfurt to Prague due to the fault of Lufthansa. Instead of arriving in Prague at 6:25pm, we arrived at Lida around 11:30pm. Yiri (brother of Jan) had to change his plan and he was there waiting for us (As I understand, they are not living onsite and Yiri & wife (Jana) and Jan & Jitka take turn to manage the property on a two-weeks rotational basis).Our 5-nights stay at Lida was very pleasant and enjoyable. It was located in a nice and quiet residential neighborhood and less than 10 minutes walk from the metro station (genial uphills) and tram station (downhill). Our unit was nice and clean with a very big picture window facing the backyard and a door which opens to the backyard. Using the very efficient public transportation systems, you can get to any tourist sites very easily. Yiri recommended two local restaurants to us and we tried both. The foods at the two restaurants were delicious and inexpensive! The breakfast at Lida was nice and we had very enjoyable conversations with other guests. Yiri speaks excellent English and he gave us clear instructions on how to use the public transportation systems. We also had a laundry done onsite at a very reasonable price.After arriving at our 2nd stop in Vienna, I realized that I left one of my clothing in the closet by accident. After notifying Yiri, he and Jana were kind enough to make a special trip to the post office and mail my clothing to me at my 4th stop in Athens. They only got their costs reimbursed about two weeks afterwards.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Lida very much and we appreciated very much the willingness of Yiri/Jana to go out their way to make their guests' stay a very pleasant one. Should we have the chance to visit Prague in the future, Lida will be our number one choice!","May 31, 2015","13    Lida Guest House

The rest of our stay was with Jan and his wife Jifka who were just as friendly and helpful. The area where the Guest House is quiet and lovely. I would have to say that in the many places our family has stayed the warmth of the owners of Lida stand out.

820,"I can't say enough about the wonderful experience my family (of five) and I had while staying at Lida Guest House. Jan and Jitka were fabulous hosts who went out of their way to provide us with an orientation to the city, see that we were comfortable, and assure that we had everything we needed to get into the center of Prague. From the moment we walked in, we felt genuinely welcomed. Our accommodations on the top floor consisted of two bedrooms (three if you count the living area that has a bed), kitchen, bathroom, and a loft. It was our own spacious apartment. The architecture of the roof made the bathroom ceiling a little low, but we didn't mind--it just made the space more quaint. We loved it.Breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Jan and Jitka were constantly making sure that everything was filled and that we had what we needed. One morning, Jan played a CD of music at breakfast that he knew we would be hearing at the symphony concert that same evening. Very thoughtful. We patronized (twice) a local restaurant that Jan recommended. The food was delicious and the prices were right.The house is about a 10-minute walk from the nearest tram stop, so it is convenient to public transportation. The trams came along regularly and whisked us into the center of Prague in less than 15 minutes. If you want to stay out of the tourist center in a place where you can have a better sense of Czech life and culture, Lida Guest House is a must.","April 7, 2015","13    Lida Guest House

821,"My dad and I stayed here for two nights in March 2015 at the beginning of our Central Europe trip. Our stay was outstanding. As other reviewers have noted, the owners of Lida are what distinguish this B&B. We had the pleasure of meeting Jiri and Jana. We took advantage of the late evening airport pickup, since we were arriving in Prague after 18 hours of travel from Los Angeles. However, public transportation is excellent in Prague, and had we landed at an earlier hour and not spent so many hours prior in a plane, it would have been easy to navigate. Lida is about 8 minutes' walk from a Metro stop and about the same amount of distance from the tram stop. Once you get on the tram or Metro, it is just a few minutes until you're in the center of things. Lida is close enough to the city's highlights but far enough away to feel like you are hanging with the locals, which you are. We had a great dinner in a restaurant recommended by Jiri (just down the hill from Lida, across from the nearest tram stop), and it was nice to enjoy Czech food with locals (and without the ridiculously inflated tourist prices!). Based on Jiri's recommendation, we finished our day of hard-core touring with a visit to Vysehrad Castle, which is about 10 minutes' walk from Lida. What a gem! The views at sunset were unbelievable. And there were lots of neighborhood folks hanging out, exercising, and simply enjoying the fact that they have an old castle in their neighborhood. The rooms are clean and the breakfast quite diverse and delicious--enough to fill you up for sightseeing and make you want to eat a late lunch. Thank you, Jiri and Jana, for making my first trip to Prague so pleasant! I hope to visit again in the near future. ","March 4, 2015","13    Lida Guest House

She knows the city very well and explained me exactly which trains I should take to go to the old city. The house is near the subway, then it is quite easy to go anywhare.

This one ranked right at the top of our list for several reasons, and as is usually the case, it was the people that ran the place. They were all so nice and accommodating, eager and willing to answer all our questions and to provide insider help on where to go and how to get there. It is located in a nice, quiet residential area that has several nice restaurants within a very short walk and it is only a 10-15 minute walk to the tram to get you to the tourist parts of town. The room was nice and large with a big enough bathroom and was very clean, as well. Breakfast was great and plentiful, too. There is a small fridge in the breakfast room stocked with drinks, beer and other stuff that works on the honor system. Some good Czesk beer for about a dollar!

829,Nice little hotel situated very near the Charles Bridge on Karlova next to St Clements Cathedral. You have to walk through (and back through) the restaurant to check in which is a little awkward with luggage unless you come in the back entrance. However we had a warm welcome and one of the guys helped with the luggage which was important as there is no lift - I guess like all the older buildings in the city. Rooms are clean. Beds are comfortable. We overlooked Karlova which is a busy street and were amazed we could not hear any sound due to excellent double glazing. Wi-fi was good too. Breakfast was expensive so we had this elsewhere. The rooms were let down slightly by the decor and some issues like lights not working and even one bedside light having exposed electrical cables which would have been dangerous with little children. (See picture). One bedroom was also missing a smoke alarm. ,"April 18, 2019","14    Residence U Malvaze

My king bed table was missing lampshades on both sides and 1 fixture has no bulbs. Both rooms has wheels missing from the desk chairs. There is no elevator which is not bad but the stairs are quite bad in places and actually slant down. Breakfast was nice and the location is great for nightlife, sights and restaurants.

My brother in law and his wife stayed at the hotel on sunday night and their room overlooked Karlova Street. He said they were woken a number of times by noisy people. We were on the other side and it was quiet. This hotel is literally three mins walk from the Charles Bridge. We took public transport to get there which was dead easy and only about £1.40 each!. We got lost in Karlova Street as the entrance is not obvious when you are trying to make sure your suitcase wheels don't get stuck in the cobbles and you are avoiding the crowds. As you turn into the street from the Charles Bridge it is about 8 shops down on the right and you need to look up above shops where there is a clear sign. That tajes you in to the restaurant and you walk through that into reception. The easier way we found was tbrough the entrance in Anenska Street.

We were then met by another member of staff to tell us the hotel had been over booked & we were being moved to The Black Star which was around 3 minute walk away down the street, which we were fine about. Our only ‘moan’ is that we were told that this room was better than the room which we would of got in our original hotel. After looking at other photographs of the room we originally booked, we aren’t too sure we got the better deal. The room was ok, large bathroom, double bed & a room with a single bed, kettle, small kitchen table, fridge & wardrobe.

The restaurant is also good, as is the Wi-Fi. The negatives are that there is no air conditioning, and no elevator. Also, with the windows open in the room it is very noisy. The stairs between the first and second floor are non-symetrical and very noisy.

However, its location means that it is also slap bang in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Prague’s nightlife. Our room had no fan or a/c and even with the windows closed, the noise from the street was quite loud. There is no lift and the stairs are uneven. The hotel itself has a quirky design which may or may not appeal. Our room was a decent size. Breakfast was ok and the staff were helpful. All in all, stay was ok, but could have been better...","June 5, 2018","14    Residence U Malvaze

844,The hotel is very central for a tourist trip to the old city of Prague. Found the hotel to be clean the staff friendly and the Restuarant offered good reasonably priced food. The breakfast was very good. Our room was very comfortable and quite spacious. The noise level at night was party people passing under the window and was quite noisy but we did sleep with the window open. Our room was on the first floor and opened onto the street at the back of the hotel. There is easy access on the opposite side from the walkway that comes off the Charles bridge which is 2 minutes walk away. Would definitely go back. ,"May 17, 2018","14    Residence U Malvaze

NO fire alarm bell in the corridor or room. This draws down the safety and standards of my part! The hotel has a parrot, the parrot woke me up Saturday and Sunday at 09:00 with its scream.

846,"Location was very good, but room being on the 2nd floor, it was very noisy. People were talking on the corridor, slamming doors, knocking doors, yelling. We woke up several times at every night. There was also live music every night at the restaurant downstairs, so if you're planning to go to sleep early, pack earplugs.One thing that was a bit weird, was that the cleaner lady tried to come to our room first time after 8am every morning. I mean if you like to sleep late, it is not very nice feeling when door opens and somebody peeps her head in. And even when the room was already cleaned fot the day, they did the same peeping in in the afternoon.

It was really really noisy. I woke up in the middle of the night several times because there were people climbing the stairs. The walls were like paper thin. What is more, for the 4 nights that we stayed, not even once were out sheets changed! When you pay €230 a night, I expect the sheets to be changed.

There are bars and restaurants nearby, not to mention the hotels own. We arrived at approx 9.30pm and check in was quick and efficient. The room was located on the 1st floor and was a good size. The bathroom was modern and the shower was very hot. The design of the shower was a bit of a problem as it flooded the bathroom, but this was not a great issue. Rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels provided. We stayed bed and breakfast. The breakfast was buffet style, and there was lots of choice, from fresh fruit, pastries, cold meats and cheeses amd omelettes to order. Check out was easy amd bags were stored until we were being collected. All staff we encountered were very friendly.

850,"The location of this hotel is steps from Charles Bridge. This is a great centre point to navigate around the city as you are right in the middle of everything. Although the hotel is situated on a hustle and bustle type street, we never found noise to be an issue. The layout of the hotel is super unique as you have to walk through their beautiful restaurateur and open an iron gate which leads you to a winding staircase to the rooms. If stairs are not your friend then be sure to request a lower level room as not only is there a lot of stairs but the unevenness of them makes it quite exhausting to walk up. It really added to the charm of the hotel though and we loved it. The rooms are exceptionally clean and well kept as well. No complaints by far for this place and for the price it is amazing. Steps from one of the largest clubs in Europe making it a safe spot to go and overall surrounded by amazing restaurants, bars, galleries, shops, and more.

851,"We stayed at Residence U Malvaze for three nights in December 2017. We checked in on a Sunday and checked out on Wednesday.The Old Town is beautiful, and it snowed a little the first night we were in Prague.Residence U Malvaze is literally 100 metres walk on the Charles Bridge. You can walk on the bridge before breakfast and avoid the crowds.Breakfast at Restaurant U Malvaze is very good, and was included in our package. We loved the freshly made omelettes.Two negative points to make:Our room was the family suite, which had two bedrooms and a bathroom, but no storage space for luggage. It was a small space for a family with two teenagers.The noise from the street was also a negative. We stayed during the lead-up to Christmas, but I could imagine it would be a year-round problem. There are several clubs nearby - we didn't hear noise from the clubs, but patrons leaving definitely weren't sympathetic to people trying to sleep.Photos attached show the view of Charles Bridge in the snow, taken from our room, the parrot which greets new guests in reception, and the fantastic Czech goulash and beer served by Restaurant U Malvaze, which is on premises by a separate business from the hotel.The airport pickup in Mercedes van was worth noting, and we would recommend the train station transfer too, which we used on check out day.","January 26, 2018","14    Residence U Malvaze

The location of the hotel is excellent - minutes from the Charles bridge and surrounded by restaurants and shops. On returning to the hotel to check in, the main reception area is lovely and also have a resident parrot - which can be vocal at times, I personally loved It! Our room was on the top floor.. 71 steps to be precise!! The room itself was spacious and beautifully decorated. It was clean and was cleaned daily throughout our stay. We had a large corner bath and a walk in shower - the only problem was the drainage and several times the shower overflowed. The receptionist couldn't be more helpful and attended and rectified the issue. Overall we both enjoyed our stay and would recommend to stay here. An enjoyable and comfortable stay. Thank you.

We often came back at the end of a busy day for a couple of drinks and was brill and good jazz music playing live too. Cannot fault the location and hotel at all really. The only negative was lack of complimentary coffee/tea facilities in the room. Really let it down for a 4 star hotel. Can’t beat a coffee or tea first thing in the morning!

870,"We chose U Malvaze, although a bit more expensive and less showy than similar hotels, due to the location near the famous Charles Bridge. We cannot imagine we were so lucky. You can reach the hotel from the airport by bus 119 that will leave you at its last stop at the metro. You must take Line city direction and drop out at Malostranska. You will reach the hotel walking for 5 minutes. This is the cheaper solution but you can also ask the hotel for a taxi that will pick up you at the fixed price of 25 Euros for up to 4 persons. Then location is the best you can desire. You do not need to buy any ticket for bus or metro nor to catch any taxi. You can easy reach every place of interest just walking. Also the castle is at 20-30 minutes walking distance.When we arrived there was a little delay in preparing one of the two rooms we have booked....they offered free bevarages for all of us (we were 4 people). All the personnel is very friendly and ready for your requests. You have to meet the owner, a very nice guy, who can help you to plan your stay at his best. The hotel has a very good and typical restaurant with regional food. You will get your breakfast in a winter garden; its roof can be opened in sunny days.The rooms are larger than usual, clean and confortable. It is very near to a five stars hotel.Well, in conclusion it was the perfect choice. ","April 30, 2017","14    Residence U Malvaze

This is such a great base for seeing all the main sights . The room was a very good standard with a super walk in shower , very modern. The room has a mini bar and also a coffee machine no kettle when we asked for one it arrived with two large cups and was no bother at all .very friendly staff .We had the breakfast option and found it filled us enough not to need lunch . As the restaurant is there we ate there in the evening . The Manager Aleksandar was excellent helping us to book our onward travel , recommended the coach to Vienna. At €15 each I was a little sceptical but wow what a service very much like a good airline free drinks and an entertainment screen in the headrest .The Hotel has a great charm with lots of great antique furniture around .

Our double room was quiet and comfortable, the beds extremely comfy and the shower was great too. The hotel was amazing apart from one morning we headed down for breakfast and as we returned to our room there was three strange men in there. It was quite a shock and to be honest quite scary as we had no pre warnings from the hotel. The men had come into our room to change the sink in the bathroom but having no communication from management to warn us wasn't great as our money and passports were laying on the bed.

882,"All of the positive reviews here are true - this small hotel is clean, beautiful, comfortable; air conditioning was very much appreciated during the recent heat wave. The breakfast buffet is phenomenal w/the usual plus homemade sweets. But what really sets this hotel apart is the service and warm welcome you feel the moment you set foot in the door. I have stayed in six other hotels in the past five months in Rome, Vienna, Budapest and Cesky-Krumlov, and the staff at this hotel surpassed all of the others in regards to friendly hospitality. Warmth and friendliness extended to my sister and her husband, who stayed around the corner at a different hotel (foolish!). Airport pick-up appreciated, also!

886,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Residence Agnes for four nights in mid-June 2019. The hotel exceeded our expectations, which were already high after reading positive reviews here and elsewhere.Location: The Agnes, with its inviting pink facade, is located on a small side street in the old section of Prague. Because there was very little vehicular traffic, it was peaceful, and there was no noise from other guest rooms. Old Town Square and the Jewish Quarter were approximately ten minutes away by foot, and several excellent restaurants were well within walking distance.Room: Our room was toward the rear of the third floor, easily accessible by elevator or stairs. It was excellent, with a comfortable bed, ample storage, strong A/C, and a modern bathroom. Storage around the sink was a bit limited, but that was only a minor concern.Common areas: The central lobby housed comfortable tables and chairs that provided overflow seating during breakfast or a place to rest on our way in. We did this many times, stopping to chat with staff and other guests while enjoying complimentary drinks and snacks.Breakfast: This was a highlight, with a broad selection of cheeses, cereals, fresh and cut fruit, cakes, eggs, and bread, among other food offerings. Although the meal was served buffet-style, staff brought juice, coffee, tea, and other items to our table.Service: I concur with others who've claimed that this was the best they've experienced anywhere. We were greeted immediately upon arrival and seated in the lobby, given drinks, asked what we would like to do in Prague, and offered suggestions for sights and tours with no pressure. Staff were genuinely interested in serving our needs throughout our stay, on one occasion delivering a pitcher of cold water to our room at no charge. Their restaurant recommendations were uniformly excellent, an all our questions were answered cheerfully. On our day of departure, we were even driven to the Prague train station — the driver refused our tip.We loved Prague, and will certainly return to the Agnes when we come back.","June 30, 2019","15    Hotel Residence Agnes

Restaurant recommendations/reservations, transportation around town, bottles of water when heading out, friendly faces and more. We overslept the last day and didn’t have time for breakfast.

There are not enough good things to say about the staff and the excellent service. They helped us with our excursions, getting around in the city, recommending which ATMs to use; and recommendations for restaurants. We visited Karlstejn castle, Prague Castle, Kutna Hora and took the Jazz Boat for dinner one night. They arranged transportation for us to get to every excursion. One day, due to the very excessive heat, they even suggested that we call the hotel to arrange for a pick up from the drop point of our excursion. Should we have the opportunity to visit Prague again, we will be staying at Hotel Residence Agnes. This is a small hotel which allows them to provide excellent service.","June 27, 2019","15    Hotel Residence Agnes

It was the right choice and the hotel although small and does not have any spa or recreation centre or swimming pool, you will feel you live in your own home with super friendly, warm and helpful staff. They picked you up from airport and made wonderful recommendations on tourist spots and restaurants. The friendly driver will send you to the Prague Castle and restaurants. When we decided to go to see the Church of Bones in Kutna Hora for day trip, the driver sent us to the main train station and helped us to buy train tickets and picked us up when we returned, all FOC. The hotel is located within short walking distance to the Old Town Square, Astronomical Clock and Charles Bridge. Our rooms are clean, nice and cosy with free drinks and snacks in the fridge. Breakfast variety is good and wifi is excellent too. You will be offered free drinks and snacks each time you return to hotel. The most wonderful thing is that they do free laundry for you on daily basis. On checking out, they asked us to pack any food from breakfast stretch and sent us to car rental to pick up our car.

The breakfast buffet was extensive and included spinach and mushroom quiche, a wide selection of fruits, bacon and ham, and assorted breads. The hotel is located in the Jewish Quarter of Prague, within walking distance of the Old Town Square. We found this location to be ideal, because it is close enough to the touristy areas, yet tucked away on a side street so that the atmosphere was quiet.

On arrival we were given a glass of wine and the receptionist was very helpful in recommending places to see and things to do during our stay.

There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but that didn’t matter one bit as the staff provide complementary drinks down in the lobby any time of day. I would recommend printing out a map if you’re walking from the train station. There are lots of winding streets but it’s a brilliant location once you’re there.

They even went to a local bakery to get me fresh gluten free bread. We were greeted on arrival by Paula who i cannot speak highly enough. She organised a walking tour for us with a guide and there was only 4 of us on the tour. So much better than the tour we saw with a guide here almost 50 people. All drinks are complimentary and we met a lot of amazing people whilst having local wines. The amazing attitude of the staff rubbed off on all the guests and I can honestly say we would be very hard pressed to find another hotel like it.

897,"This is a very nice hotel in a great location. It is just outside the Old Town but a 5/10 minute walk to the Old Town Square. As it is slightly out of the Old Town it is in a nice quiet area. We asked for a quiet room and could hear no noise either from outside or from the other rooms. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble for them. If you wanted, they would get you tickets, book restaurants and even run you where you wanted to go! We booked the shuttle to and from the airport and it was excellent. There are some lovely touches such as complimentary tea, coffee, water, beer and wine 24/7. We like to be able to make tea and coffee in our room and, although it is not standard, they happily provided a kettle, cups etc for us to use. The breakfast is extensive and excellent, hot food, cereals,sweet good etc - even cherries picked from the managers(owner?) garden! The only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that, although the rooms are clean and comfortable (we had a deluxe double) I expected a bit more luxury for the price. Similarly, the bathroom was clean and spacious but quite basic. All in all though, a very nice hotel and we would stay there again if we returned to Prague.","June 12, 2019","15    Hotel Residence Agnes

915,"My husband and I have traveled fairly extensively .One always hopes for a good experience when you enter an accommodation.From the moment you enter Hotel Residence Agnes, you are treated to an unbelievable experience. The receptionist, greets you, asks if you would like a wine,beer,or something else, and then sits with you and reviews what you want to do in Prague. She then arranges your tours, concert tickets, and dinner reservations. I cannot say enough about the staff and owner.They go above and beyond! The breakfast buffet was astounding ! During breakfast, staff comes around to,offer you even more delicacies! Twice the owner walked us to different sites in the neighborhood- he even escorted us to astore where we purchased beautiful Bohemian glass!Prague is a beautiful city, made even more satisfying by our experience in this wonderful hotel and their incredible service team- thank you Paula, and Frank, and all of you!","April 28, 2019","15    Hotel Residence Agnes

916,"This is by far the best hotel I ve ever stayed and I am comparing it to Grand Tourism +5 stars hotels- all inclusive; this super cute and small but very unique hotel has an exquisite service; their staff are extremely kind. They could have an Agnes Hotel in every city of the world and I would actually stay at! Included breakfast is wide in options, delicious in every bite!! Tastes like homemade food, ( Compared to Coffee & just bread) that mostly all hotels give you) This is a must. This is the best hotel in Prague. I will come back for sure.

918,"We have just had a fantastic stay at this lovely hotel, which is in a great location. The staff are faultless. They are friendly, polite and super efficient. Nothing is too much trouble for them. We have stayed in many hotels over the world but have never received such wonderful service, including from some expensive luxury hotels. The staff are unobtrusive but always ready to assist with free shuttle service, advice regarding things to see and good restaurants.We were greeted warmly from the moment we arrived and offered complimentary beer and wine every time we entered the lobby. This was very welcome, particularly after a long day sightseeing in the beautiful city of Prague. The hotel is situated perfectly, close to everything but in a quiet spot.The rooms, although not having the very latest technology, have everything you need for a comfortable stay. They are modern rooms so don't expect character and tradition. The beds are huge.Breakfast is fantastic, loads of options and attentive service in a pleasant room.If you want a reasonably priced hotel that is clean and comfortable, with superb service, in a quiet but central location, this is the hotel for you. Highly recommended.","April 20, 2019","15    Hotel Residence Agnes

The complimentary hotel driver will take you to restaurants, do pick ups from the airport etc and the breakfast buffet is fabulous with a massive choice. NOTHING is too much trouble for the team, they really want you to enjoy your stay. They will recommend places to visit, book restaurants for you and take care of every little detail. Then its complimentary soft and alcholic drinks in the foyer after your days out so you can chat with other guests making your stay so much more intimate than a larger hotel. Its so right to give them a 5 star the entire team from front of house to the chefs and cleaners make this such a very special place and a great experience.

Delicious buffet breakfast with every sort of hot and cold food you could wish for.Complimentary tea/ coffee in the foyer on return everyday - and always a lovely welcome from staff.Have stayed in many hotels, but never had this degree of genuine hospitality.

Stop wasting your time researching for places to stay when visiting Prague. Book your accommodation at Residence Agnes. You will not be disappointed. Great location. Well appointed rooms. The service ?? Awesome !!!!! We have stayed at five star hotels before but have never felt the personal touch you feel when you stay here. All the review regarding the service at this hotel are true 100% All the staff is extremely courteous and go out of their way to make your stay memorable and stress free.

We loved our stay so much that we have booked to return at the end of the year. The location is perfect. The breakfast was delicious but really it is the people that make it a special place to stay. Paula was utterly charming, she was especially kind to our children. We were collected from the airport and taken back (complimentary of booking directly with the hotel). We also enjoyed complimentary lifts to Prague Castle and the Ice Bar one evening. Paula also booked us concert tickets which made everything easy. One of my favourite elements was that you can enjoy a glass of wine or a beer in the lobby area (again this is included).

926,"The folks at Hotel Residence Agnes give a warm welcome to their guests, helping in every way possible. In 50 years of traveling, never have I discovered such a high level of hospitality - not just upon arrival, but throughout our entire stay. Other travelers we met there agreed - the level of service and hospitality provided was truly exceptional and unlike anything we had previously experienced.Frank, the owner/manager, and EVERY employee at Hotel Residence Agnes, are truly focused on customer service and satisfaction. We arrived hours before the stated check-in time given an early flight from Budapest. Frank showed us to the dining room and invited us to partake in the buffet breakfast. One of his associates, Klara, brought us a map and discussed our plans and interests, as well as made some suggestions. They kept our luggage and Frank personally drove us to the National Museum, all before we even checked in or got in the room! (The Hotel was fully booked). They even washed a bag of laundry for us.On the day we checked out, we had a very early flight at the airport- Frank arranged for a car service to take us (complimentary). His night staff even prepared a bag breakfast for each of us, as we departed before the breakfast buffet was open. To summarize, Hotel Residence Agnes truly provides much more than a room - they provide hospitality extraordinaire!The rooms we had were large, clean and well kept. The hotel is located in the old town - just a short walk to the Astronomical Clock. We found the location very convenient to the main sites. There are lots of restaurants nearby. About a 5 minute walk away is Mikulka’s Pizzeria - good pizza at a reasonable price. One night got a carry-out pizza and ate at one of the many tables in the hotel lobby, with complimentary beverages provided by the gracious hosts at Hotel Residence Agnes.They provided some other transportation as well during our stay - to the Jazz Boat one night; to a shop to buy a cheap suitcase one day.At the reception desk, they have a community “tip jar” which is shared among all staff. This was very convenient to leave the collective tip for all of them at check out. Superior service and superior hospitality warrants a generous tip!Thanks to everyone at Hotel Residence Agnes!You are the best.","April 8, 2019","15    Hotel Residence Agnes

927,"We stayed at this lovely small hotel for a weekend trip to Prague. I chose the hotel based upon the amazing reviews of the service. Therefore it is only fair that I leave a review as well.Please stay here.... the staff are so lovely and helpful, they really do go the extra mile.We arrived quite late on the Friday evening and were met by a lovely receptionist who offered us a drink and sat with us and talked us through the city map and marked out a suggested route for exploring the city the following day. She also made a reservation for dinner at a traditional fine dining restaurant for us. The hotel owner gave us free funicular tickets and even dropped us off there in the morning. We had a room on the 4th floor which was nice and spacious. So, the decor is a little plain and there aren’t the usual 5 star additions of a coffee machine etc, but the rooms are clean, spacious, and perfectly adequate for sleeping. Remember, this is a listed building so they cant make many changes. After all, on a city break how much time do you spend in your room anyway?Breakfast was amazing, so many things to choose from, and the staff are so friendly. There is no bar or restaurant that caters for dinner in the hotel but everything at breakfast was freshly baked ( bread, cakes, pastries etc) and lots of hot food plus cereals and fruit.We can’t recommend this little hotel enough.

The only downside is that we have to leave and can’t imagine any other hotel stays could ever measure up!

930,"""Helpful"" does not come close to describing our experience with this great hotel. From the moment we showed up, bedraggled and sleep-deprived, Pawla and her colleague went to extraordinary lengths to make us feel welcome. Immediately on our arrival, they gave us coffee and pastries. Every morning, we availed ourselves to a free breakfast, which included excellent fresh baked pastries, coffee, fresh juice, omelettes, fresh fruit, etc. Car service to various destinations is free (they also picked us up at the airport). But best of all, they gave the best advice on where to go, where to eat, and what to see. Truly they made this trip memorable. The hotel itself is quite small (about twenty rooms), and on a quiet street just five minutes walk from the Old Town and the Jewish Quarter. Exactly where you want to be, in other words.

(25 Min Walk Prague Castle, 10 Min to Astronomical Clock, 15 Min Charles Bridge) There is also a Tesco located near buy so you can pick up groceries to store in the small kitchenette. The room was clean and the price was reasonable…but saying that comes with some caveats. First, the rooms (at least he one we stayed in) do not AT ALL look like the pictures on the website. While the space itself is large, it is dated looking. Do not stay here if you are looking for the cute apartment vibe the pictures indicate, as it isn’t accurate, for all of the rooms.  One other comment that bares saying but didn’t impact our experience there was that on the lower levels it is very loud. There is a bar directly across from the entrance, which our windows opened on to, so it was loud late into the evening. Also the doors are extremely heavy and slam loudly.

Amazing thing that reception is open 24/7, although I was not expecting an early checkout at 10 am (normally seen at midday). The staff are super friendly and welcoming, as I was travelling alone, they offered their company in case I would feel lonely. The studio apartment that I stayed (superior studio) was quite big, the bed, probably a queen size, super comfortable. Had a small kitchenette, from which I only used the fridge for yogurt, was clean and had the essentials. The bathroom was decent size, including the shower and everything worked perfectly.Overall I highly recommend the place for location, price, comfort, tidiness and friendly staff.

My partner and I did not take public transport the entire time as everything was less than 30 mins away (the Astronomical clock is 5 mins away and the Prague Castle is 25). There is also a shopping centre with a Tesco nearby so everything we needed were just yards away.I really recommend this hotel.","February 23, 2019","16    City Nest

955,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel! The flat was really new and everything was in good condition. There’s a small kitchen area for people to prepare food if needed and very good insulation and heating (which was great as it was the coldest week when we visited!). There was renovation work going on at the venue next door that got quite loud during our first night there but the hotel was very nice about it and refunded the first night and gave us a bottle of sparkling wine to make up for it which was a nice surprise and we were really grateful for that :) All the staff spoke perfect English so we checked in and out with no problems at all. The location of the hotel was also really convenient — only a two minute walk away from the subway and tram stations, and within walking distance to most of the tourist attractions such as the astrological clock and the Charles bridge.

The staff was exceptional in every interaction we had with them and arranged for transfers for us upon arrival at the train station and departure from the apartments to the airport at a very reasonable rate. We were in Prague during some VERY hot days (100 degrees fahrenheit), and our second floor apartment was not air conditioned. We opened all of the windows and were given two Dyson fans, which did help cool down the apartment somewhat.If we ever find ourselves in Prague again during our travels, we would definitely stay at MOOo by the Castle.","July 9, 2019","17    MOOo by the Castle

963,"This was our first visit to Prague and we weren’t sure if we wanted to stay downtown or near the castle, and we really think that Mooo by the castle is the best location! We were close to the castle and shops and restaurants, but on a quiet little side street which was perfect. An easy walk to the Charles Bridge and then you are right at the Old Square! Location was exactly what we wanted! The building and courtyard are lovely...we returned home one afternoon to find a local show with singing and dancing being performed by local children and adults. Charming! The individual apartments are beautifully and tastefully decorated. The furniture was comfortable and modern. The kitchen had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and it was all very clean. The bathroom was beautiful too, great shower! It was VERY hot in Prague during our visit so we were grateful to have air conditioning in our two units. If that is important to you, I suggest you request it when you book. Not all of the apts have it. I imagine there would be a nice breeze, though, as there are lots of large windows that you can open in your apt. I really can’t think of anything we would have changed!

971,"We stayed here for four days/three nights at the beginning of May, in a one-bedroom apartment. The apartment itself was great, with a spacious bedroom, and a living room with a decent kitchen set-up and dining table. Front desk staff were great in answering any questions we had. MOOo is located on a small side street (actually, more like a small side walkway) off Nerudova. It's a fairly steep set of stairs and sidewalk down, or alternately, you can come up to the hotel if you start below it at Bretislavova (we found that a little easier). We came in from the Prague airport via the 119 bus and then the subway. The closest stop for the subway is Malostranska, which left us with a walk of about 15 minutes. Alternately you can take the aboveground tram, which leaves you off at Malostranske square, and then it's just 5 minutes and a couple blocks uphill to the hotel.Pro tip: there's a Starbucks in the square right where the tram stop is. I know that travel is supposed to be about broadening your perspective and experiencing the local culture and all, but we had a couple of mornings where we just wanted to get coffee and get out into the city, so that worked out well for us. MOOo is a 5-10 minute walk to the Castle complex, depending on how fast you motor uphill. It's also all of about 10 minutes from the Charles Bridge. The Wallenstein Gardens are also nearby, on the walk between the hotel and the metro stop. One of the days we walked past, the doors were open and we decided to check it out, and it was a lovely space to explore. Petrin Park is also nearby, and while you are up at the castle, you can check out Novy Svet. One thing you should know about this place is that the stairs leading up are a bit of a challenge. They are pitched more steeply than what would be considered standard in the US, and they slant a little downward. Max, who was the person who greeted us and set us up when we arrived, told us that the building is something like 500 years old and is a UNESCO protected site, and that they are limited in what they can renovate, so the stairs are what they are. We were able to get up and down without mishap, but someone with mobility issues might find this a bit problematic. That said, we would stay here again without question. Overall, we had an excellent experience here.","May 12, 2019","17    MOOo by the Castle

To start, the staff were always warm, welcoming, and eager to help. For example, we quickly realized that we had forgotten to bring electrical outlet converters and they were more than happy to lend us a couple when asked. The apartment was spacious, clean and modern, but still retained a cozy rustic feel. The kitchenette was well stocked with cups, utensils, an espresso machine, electric teapot, cooking ware, microwave, and even a dishwasher. Both the main bed and pull out beds were very comfortable and the latter was a surprise as this is usually not the case. My favorite feature was the extra touch of the heated floors in the bathroom. We absolutely loved our stay there and only wish there were more Mooo properties that we could stay at in the future. This is a rare find and I would highly recommend this apartment for a stay in Prague. It was also very close to the Prague Castle which was an added plus.

The building itself is beautifully restored. The children particularly liked climbing up the fairy tale tower and greeting Cookie the Cow every time we crossed the main gate. The apartments are spacious, clean, well-maintained, quiet, tastefully decorated, and nice and warm in the winter. The location is also great, right in the middle of Mala Strana and a short walk or tram ride from the Old Town. In addition to the sights and picturesque lanes, we enjoyed Mala Strana's quieter nightlife. Dinners at very nearby Santini Garden, U Magistra Kelly and Kuchyn were all excellent. The alchemy-themed bar on the ground floor was also fun and worth checking out.But what really makes Mooo stand out is the staff.

The apartments are beautiful and the staff is attentitive and truly care about the happiness of the guests. Each apartment is surprisingly large. We had a group who rented the 2 bedroom and the 1 bedroom, and they were both really big with plenty of space to socialize and sit. The hotel location is an easy walk to most everything you want to see in the city, though be prepared to walk uphill when returning to the hotel. You can find multiple restaurants and bars within a couple blocks, but it is a very quiet area. Inside the hotel is tower you can walk up (about 4 stories) and look out over the city. There is a bar downstairs that cannot be missed. It incorporates the Alchemist history associated with the building. Don't let the quirky name fool you.

989,"We stayed here after reading all the other excellent reviews. There really is a reason why they have so many 5/5 reviews! First of all, the location is excellent, you’re in the centre of everything you’d want to be (and if you book on their website you get airport transfer included). There are loads of places to go for food and drink within 5 minutes walk as well. The room itself was excellent, comfortable bed, big tv, Bose sound system, Nespresso machine. It was spotlessly clean and came with a nice bottle of Prosecco on arrival as well. They also had a cot and high chair waiting for us (we travelled with an 11 month old). Finally the service from the staff was exceptional. There was nothing they couldn’t do. As we were leaving, we had half an hour wait for our taxi and an American member of staff made us feel very welcome getting us coffee, chatting to us etc. There is not one thing I could think of that needs improving in this place, it really is that good!","December 8, 2018","17    MOOo by the Castle

At first I was unsure about the 1 blanket per person set up but my husband and I ended up loving it. No more having your blankets stolen from you in the middle of the night. The neighborhood was safe and very quiet at night. It was a welcome escape from the hordes of people in Old Town. The only suggestion that I have is maybe adding a full length mirror in the bedroom. The few minor hiccups we had...no towel replacements for the first 3 days of our trip and an issue with the hot water... were resolved promptly and with a smile.A word of caution... the hotel is partway up a small but steep hill and our room (#14) was on the 3rd floor with no elevator. While this was not a problem for us, it may be a problem for some. If you have trouble with stairs, maybe ask for a room on a lower floor.","October 25, 2018","17    MOOo by the Castle

995,"We had a wonderful stay at MOOo by the Castle Apartments! Before our stay I communicated with the hotel directly, and they were so helpful and informative. We stayed in a Two Bedroom Apartment Monday until Friday, and we enjoyed a spacious, clean and luxurious apartment where they had though of everything. The kitchenette was super and had all the necessary amenities that 4 (or more) people would need, the living room was spacious as well as the two bedrooms that were absolutely perfect, beautiful decorated and very spacious. Just outside the door to the aparment you can enjoy the view of the court yard, and it was very relaxing sitting there, enjoying a cup of coffee and the view of the yard.The location of the hotel is super, about 5-10 minutes walking to the Charles Bridge (Karlův most), and therefore a super starting point for experiencing Prague.All of the staff were so helpful, nice and service minded. We have stayed at a lot of hotels, but we all experienced a lot more service than you will at other hotels. Because we had a late flight we asked to keep the room a bit longer than 12 o'clock, and that was not a problem - and they would not charge us anything extra for it either.

998,"Yes, part of the reason why I choose MOOo by the Castle was the cow theme. But aside from that the apartment, building and courtyard were simply beautiful. I stayed in Apartment 1, which was ground floor facing the street. This wasn't much of a problem as the street was quiet at night. The only potential problem was leaving windows open while you were out (this apartment did not have air-con). The furniture was of a high quality and I loved the various cow-related furnishings. The kitchen comes with lots of utensils and the mini fridge is a decent size. This apartment did not come with a separate bath, but the shower had a rain shower head.Staff were awesome, very friendly and fulfilled everything I needed. The location is up a slope, so that may be a concern for those with mobility issues. If not, I found it great. Within walking distance to the Castle and Charles Bridge and also a tram station. There's also a small supermarket just up the slope, that closes at 23:00, and some restaurants nearby, including Santini Garden just across the street.MOOo and Prague itself exceeded my expectations and I would love to come back.","August 30, 2018","17    MOOo by the Castle

Anything and everything from getting extra pods for the nespresso machine to printing our boarding passes they did with the upmost professionalism. The apartment itself was nothing short of five stars: nespresso coffe machine for those mornings after the night before; Bose Bluetooth speakers and Netflix for afternoon siestas; and most importantly the cleanliness from the daily maid service made it a comfortable place to relax. The location itself was nothing more than ideal, short walk from places to eat and drink but far enough you’re not kept up at night with the loud hustle and bustle.

But it feels more natural than it sounds and really give a secure feeling.You can park just outside the apartments, but only briefly while unloading and checking in. The hotel can arrange parking, but we choose mrparkit and got to park somewhat cheaper and inside.Then jumped on a tramp to the area near the apartment. Worked great.We had an apartment on the top floor. It had aircondition which was nice as it was warm. The apartment had a kitchen with most of what we needed. Could use a toaster though.A nice bathroom with a giant rainfall shower.A living room with a big sofabed and a large TV.Then a bedroom with a TV and a safe.Everything is very clean and the decoration of the apartment is great. You can sit outside the apartments as the is café table and chairs. You have a nice view over the yard from here and even a peek at the castle.The staff is very friendly and speaks great English as some of staff are even from the states.From the apartments, you can walk to the castle and the old town via the bridge.There are lots of places to eat in the area.In the yard of the apartments they serve great beers.This is the type of apartment you want to return to, so I highly recommend MOOo.","July 20, 2018","17    MOOo by the Castle

It is not that far from the town as it seems. Prague is an old architecture town and walking is what you want to do! The staff was great and very polite and chatty.

Comfy and clean. Everything feels brand new. Tucked away in a quiet and quant area near amazing restaurants and all of the embassies. Just a two minute walk to the bridge. Staff is very warm and friendly. Only downfall is no air conditioning. We have fans but it’s still a bit warm at night.

They were so thoughtful and even left a bottle of prosecco to cheer us up (even though we did not get round to drinking it in the end).You can get your breakfasts a few steps away at their sister hotel and I would definitely recommend you do that. Well balanced breakfast that is not stingy.Andrew (kudos for the good communication over email) or someone else is often at the desk on the 1st level during regular working hours but outside those hours, you can always get the information or assistance you need from the sister hotel across the road – so best of both worlds.Don’t even need to ask me whether I would be staying there again!","June 23, 2019","18    MOOo Downtown

Eventually we came across Moos, rang it up and were answered by a very friendly receptionist. All our questions have been answered and we decided to go for Moo!! The apartment has more or less met our expectations. In fact bathroom wer fewer than we expected, but in all other respects it was great.

1054,"Dear hotel management,I would like to raise your attention on the POOR service of tour reservation to Cesky Krumlov on 19 Nov 2018. On 19 Nov 2018, Tereza helped us booked a tour to Cesky Krumlov on 25 Nov 2018. On 20 Nov 2018, we paid CZK 940 to Ondřej [--] (A tall guy with brown hair). On 25 Nov 2018, around 8:20 am, we asked Ondřej [--] where we should wait for the tour bus, and please help us call someone to confirm this question, he said ""you should have asked when you booked the tour."" and left us to wait in the cold weather. I went over to Mosaic House and asked for help from a woman with dark and curly hair to shoulder, but she did not do anything and asked me to wait outside. I called the number +420 606 600 123 to Premiant City Tour many times but no one answered the phone. At 8:50 am, I asked the woman with dark hair to call PremiantTour for me, and they said we did not book the tour, although we paid booking fee CZK 940. Finally, she helped us book the tour, charged us CZK 1358 for final bill and confirmed no more payment would be charged to us. She asked us to wait inside Mosaic House but did not mention how much time we should wait. How come there was no one inform us about this bad news in advance and why there was no proper handover between hotel staffs, and we had to bear this kind of horrible service and wait outside for nothing???At 9:20 am, Ondřej [--] informed us the tour guide arrived and we finally joined the tour. On 26 Nov 2018, when we checked out, Mr. [--] asked us to pay CZK 1464. HOW COME there is more payment to be made!!!!!! I refused to pay but he said he would charge me even if I left Prague because he has my credit card detail. In the end, I paid 940+1358+1464=3762. May I know what's wrong with the whole service? I was happy that the Moon apartment was nice and comfortable but I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED at the tour reservation service and how staff treated us as we are nothing.","December 2, 2018","18    MOOo Downtown

1055,"Over the past several decades I have regularly travelled for business and pleasure and have stayed in hundreds of lodgings. I avoid glitzy hotels because they are rarely worth the price. We frequently select stylish hotels that are not your usual box with a bed. The MOOo Downtown is such a rare gem, a hotel with style, humor, class and personalized customer service. Eric is the manager and superstar concierge.My wife and I are very partial to Jugendstil architecture and furnishings. The MOOo Downtown has been renovated and modernized, but the original Jugendstil features (such as door handles, door glass and ceilings are still there. Otherwise, expect a modern, thoughtful floor plan and all the amenities you expect in a new extended stay hotel. The MOOo Downtown is conveniently located within walking distance of the entire Old City. Although Prague has one of the best public transport systems, we chose to walk to most places. (If you are 75 or older and an EU resident, the city transportation system is free. If you are 60+, the cost is quite reasonable.)There are many good restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the MOOo Downtown and our host took care of all the reservations. The service and food quality in Prague have made quantum leaps forward in the last 25 years. Especially good is the French bakery nextdoor and the new Italian restaurant next to the Boat-hotel, on the river, 4 blocks away.The MOOo Downtown is one of the most pleasant hotel stays I have ever had.

But of much more importance, her infectious sense of humor kept us from drifting into the well-known traveler's despondency (short-lived as it may be). If we had an unfortunate incident in exploring Prague (getting lost, for instance), she helped us see the bright side. She is the Energizer Bunny, racing about to care for her guests in whatever way they need. My wife requested a fan, and after we returned from a walk it was in our room. The fact that Kristina speaks a number of languages doesn't hurt either. The accommodations are very comfortable. We took advantage of the offer to upgrade to a suite, and we had ample room to ourselves.

The hotel is located a few blocks from the Anděl metro station and 2 blocks from the Vltava River. Turn left at the river to walk to the Charles Bridge and Old Town Square. Turn right at the river to walk to Vyšehrad. Public transportation is awesome in Prague, but walking, for those who can, is the best. Don’t forget to look up. The hotel is Pink! It is very clean with single rooms or little apartments with kitchenettes (tea provided). The beds are very comfortable, and the thick walls and double (or triple?) pane windows keep the rooms quiet. There is instant hot water for showers, and bathrooms are of decent proportion.The very best part of the Aparthotel City 5 is the hotel owner, Kristina. She wins in all categories of hospitality. Kristina welcomes you from the first email conversation to the personal greeting and orientation you receive upon arrival. Breakfast in the hotel cafe extends the welcome with warm toasties (ham and cheese panini), assorted breads, cheese, fruit, cereal, coffee, tea and Kristina, making sure everyone gets seated and served. We’ve had many interesting conversations with people from around the world in that cafe. Book before she fills up!","December 28, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

1072,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and felt at home. Kristina, who manages the place, gave us a warm welcome when we arrived, freezing and tired from a night flight, offered us warm drinks and sat with us patiently giving her brief review of all the highlights in Prague, marking them on the map for us. The hotel has a perfect location for public transportation, which compensates the fact it's not right in the center, yet it is located in a an area which is not too noisy. The apartment was very clean and had small kitchen with all the essentials. The hotel has a reception from 08:00-20:00 which is advantageous. In short, this hotel was the perfect choice for us.","December 12, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

1073,"Kristina was very responsive and made sure we didn't have any worries when we arrived to Prague. She graciously sent many directions and information about how to get to the Aparthotel, with common rates and what to expect and even some tips and what-not to dos that come out to be very helpful. Once we arrived we were treated like family. We were given tea and toastys and I wasn't feeling well and Kristina just moved with such grace, offering me honey and a nice nap right away. She went over a beautiful map of Prague and helped us plan out our 4 days in town. She gave us lots of materials to learn more and how to explore this magical city. It really does give you energy and power. I felt it everywhere we went. I just loved staying here so much, the room was large! We had complimentary tea every morning on our rooms, because we have a kitchen! We loved having the lounge downstairs, we had breakfast there every morning. Kristina was so generous to offer a welcome breakfast and even do our laundry. We could not be more thankful. Kristina has a place in our hearts forever!! I sincerely suggest any one staying here, you will not be sorry!","November 19, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

1074,"Kristina was the best host ever! This was my first time to Prague and I worried a bit about location but the public transportation is excellent. This hotel is just three minutes from the buses, subway and tram. Public transportation from the airport takes about forty minutes and cost about a dollar. A 3 day pass is only about $13.00. It's a beautiful walk to the old part of town from this hotel, it takes less than an hour. The rooms have everything, microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, fan and a modern bathroom. Breakfast each morning was included and plentiful complimented by Kristina's excellent coffee. Kristina was available everyday with tips of what's going on around town. Prague is a very vibrant city and the area around the Aparthotel City 5 is not exception, a large indoor mall, grocery stores and plenty or bars and restaurants that are excellent and a better value than eating in touristy parts of the city.","October 6, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

1075,I have been coming to the Aparthotel for many years. The welcome from this place is warm and friendly. Kristina who runs the place makes you feel really at home and she goes the extra mile to make sure your visit is a pleasure. The rooms are bright and spacious and very clean and comfortable. The location is near Andel tube which makes it a short journey to get to anywhere in Prague. The river is nearby and it's a nice walk into town if you prefer to do that. Nearby are local markets and nice restaurants which are reasonably priced. I recommend the Czech restaurants nearby. The brewey is also nearby and worth a visit. Just five minutes away is a shopping centre with everything you could possibly want.This place is a good choice.,"September 30, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

The balcony was an unexpected extra!The breakfasts were lovely too, in a really comfortable environment - quiet, but cheerful and exceptionally welcoming.However, the best words that I have must be reserved for Kristina who runs the Aparthotel with such care and enthusiasm. Kristina loves her city and I really think that she is committed to ensuring that everyone that stays at Aparthotel City 5 has the best experience of Prague possible. She is so knowledgeable about the city and advises you about specific areas that may interest you, in addition to the popular tourist sites.Kristina is one in a million - I think everyone should visit Prague, and everyone should go and stay at Aparthotel City 5 :-).

1080,"First – Let me say that EVERYTHING prior TA reviews have said about Kristina is true. She is the most welcoming, friendly, and helpful Concierge I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Her suggestions and help made our well-planned trip to Prague even better.Reaching the correct stop on the metro is super easy from the main train station – Florenc. Take the yellow line towards Zlicin, and exit at the to the Andel station. Once in the station take the exit towards the BUS sign. Walk through the bus area until you reach the corner. Cross the street directly ahead and turn left immediately. [i..e. away from the restaurant with the big green beer sign]. At the first intersection turn right. – this is Vltavska St. The hotel, painted a rosy pink, is about half way down this street. If you keep going, you will walk right to the river. Press the intercom button for admittance.Kristina upgraded our apartment, so it was very roomy. The kitchen was well equipped. We had a full size fridge, microwave, cook top and hot pot. There was a comfy couch in the living area and a good chair in the bedroom. It was squeaky clean. There were lots of extra towels. Kristina has a lot of good travel info downstairs as well as a book exchange. The wifi signal was strong our entire trip. We found the apartment nice and quiet.One advantage of staying out here were the restaurants. Kristina recommended 2 that we enjoyed very much –the Na Veranda’ch [ the one with the big green beer sign, which was the brewery restaurant] and the Andel Plzensky in the opposite direction on Nadrazni. I had one of the best duck dinners ever there. If you are a beer drinker there are a lot of local brews on tap to try. We liked all the ones we tried. We also tried and liked very much a local place a bit further down Vltavska St on the other side of the street from the hotel. They had a bar upstairs and the restaurant downstairs. I think it was called the Katerina, or something similar. All the fun beers we had tried were here as well – just less expensive. The food was very good. There is also a Tesco supermarket nearby off of Nadrazni just past where all the trams are. At the corner where you first turn there is a fun little pastry and ice cream shop that is worth a stop.To leave for the airport, go back to Andel station and take the yellow line to the end of the line at Zlicin. Exit the station and turn right. The bus pick up for Bus 100 to the airport is only a few yards away and well-marked. Buy a 90 minute metro ticket which will get you on this bus as a transfer - no need to buy a separate ticket. From exiting the hotel to entering Terminal 1 took us an hour. Do plan on extra time [at least 1 hour] as the check-in process at the Prague Airport is VERY slow.I would not consider staying anywhere else on any subsequent trips to Prague.","July 1, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

As others have noted, the woman who runs the hotel, Kristina, is amazing! - very warm and welcoming and informative. She really made our visit to Prague better by advising us and making us feel at home.

As we were travelling in a budget this was the most affordable place we could find still at £60pn but in Prague that seemed cheap now and for what we got it was excellent. So glad we stretched our budget and found this place.Location - yep it’s a little out of the old (25-30 min walk) and new town (15-20 min walk) but Prague is lovely to walk around so sad don’t bother us. Also loads better f restaurants and bars nearby much cheaper than in those tourist areas including being right next to staropramen and their sister restaurant mmmmmm. Less than 5 min walk to metro and major bus interchange and tram lines. Tesco 5-10 min walk away. Room - it’s an apartment and very clean, spacious and great facilitiesBreakfast - we had once as saving money but it was great at €4 a head and there was tonnes.

1086,"First let me say that Kristina's personal welcome introducing you to her city is exceptional. A good breakfast is served in the welcoming entrance lounge and the apartment rooms are very clean. However, as the 5th most popular hotel in Prague based on travellers reviews, I have to say that overall it did not live up to my expectations and I will echo comments made by another traveller in 2008. It might be that reviews I have read made me expect more, but the rooms whilst perfectly functional lack charm with their tiled floors and basically lino surfaces. In addition, the curtains did not quite cover the windows so street lights shone in. And although it is a short walk from the river and there are good local restaurants round the corner, it was further away from most tourist sites than I had expected. It is all perfectly fine for the price but sadly apart from Kristina herself, the place just did not quite live up to my expectations based on reviews I had read.","April 22, 2018","19    Aparthotel City 5

1088,"We had a wonderful time at Aparthotel City 5 in Prague. It was our first time staying on this side of the river and hadn’t much explored the Smichov neighborhood. Our expectations were exceeded! The hotel is located just a couple blocks from a major transportation hub with Metro, trams, and buses (city and regional). If you want to take a day trip to Cesky Krumlov, can’t recommend this location enough as you’re just 5 min away. Or you can walk in the other direction just a couple blocks to the Vltava River. The rooms are mini apartments with a kitchenette including everything you might want to make a meal. The laundry service is super convenient. We didn’t have breakfast but the spread looked awesome. Last but most importantly, Kristina the owner was friendly and kind and unbelievably helpful. She gave us lots of recommendations for things to do in Prague and the neighborhood and overall was just a super lovely person to have as a host. Oh and the price. She could charge a lot more!

Room was spotless. bed was nice & firm as I prefer. Shower was European so you have to watch where you are spraying or you get a wet floor!

It literally is a full apartment!! Best value and most space we’ve seen in anywhere in Europe. The location is just outside of old town, a quick 20 min walk along the very scenic river, maybe 25 if you’re a slow walker. But honestly we loved the walk. There is also a tram just around the corner if you’re not up for the short hike. First impression of the location can be daunting (a lot of graffiti etc), but don’t worry it’s completely safe!!!!

1098,"I fly standby. While sitting in the gate at JFK and knowing I would be on the flight I got busy trying to find a place to stay. I came across the listing for Aparthotel City 5 and couldn't believe what I was seeing. How can it be possible to have so many excellent reviews? And how could this ""Kristina"" possibly be so good? The countdown to boarding was getting close. For me a leap of faith as I usually try to research every angle. I booked for 4 nights and got on the plane! That was the beginning of my good fortune on a wonderful trip to a city I'd never been to.  I'm not going to try to come up with something new and clever to say about Kristina.I've been in customer service and now the hotel business all my life. She is the most professional, knowledgeable,and welcoming person I've ever come across. With a wonderful sense of adventure and humor!  She knows how to read people and suggest ideas they may not consider. She also opened the door when I arrived and sat me down to a cup of coffee and pulled out a fresh map of the city. And her pen! And twenty minutes later I was out the door!  All in all, I must've seen one hundred sights in Prague and the day trips Kristina suggested to different cities. (Later that day I checked my emails and found one that Kristina had sent immediately after I made my reservation. In that email she outlined how to get to her hotel and an offer to have a driver pick me up. I found it easy to take the city bus from the airport to a stop that I would be seeing a lot of in the future!) To bring a close to a long review I'll leave you with this. I had originally made a four day reservation. I ended up staying eleven! I mentioned to Kristina that I made my decision based on the reviews. She seemed to be aware but not impressed. I hope to be back someday. I know where to stay now.And you will enjoy the toasties along with the entire breakfast layout.I enjoyed not having someone from the staff in my room during my stay. I'll let you know if I need anything.Most enjoyable was the two separate loads of laundry done at no cost or hassle!And meeting the others each morning at breakfast.

You will find nowhere someone so warmly welcoming. Kristina welcomes every guest personally, gives you full information about Prague's sightseeing (she actually planned our stay in Prague during that meeting, so we were able to see the most of it in only 4 days), and is very helpful in any situation. Kristina, thank you for everything - you made our trip perfect!","October 21, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

1102,"I arrived at Aparthotel City 5 afterhours as a fatigued stranger, but left four days later as the manger’s best friend. This is the experience that any reasonable tourist will have after meeting Kristina. She stayed late to welcome me and to begin my orientation to Prague. Kristina’s love for her city is infectious. The apartment, away from the chaos of old town, was a good location. When the 20-minute walk to the city center became a bit much, I took the nearby tram after Kristina’s simple introduction to local transportation. My apartment was large and clean. It had plenty of positives but someone looking for ‘fancy’ might be less happy. The most impressive elements of my stay were: Kristina, her bountiful and inexpensive breakfast, and the fact that everyone (three delightful couples) I met at breakfast had stayed at AC5 multiple times. It will certainly be my Prague home again if I have the good fortunate to return.","October 20, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

And we were late than we should be, I called her and her warm voice told me not to worry, she will be there for us. When we got there, she opened the door and gave us very passionate welcome. We felt like we were home. She cared about my foot and thought of many details to help me release my pain and inconvenience. She gave us the most useful information to see prague, so Prauge is my favorite during this trip. I also like her breakfast and beautiful small garden. When I am back, I definitily will stay in this hotel again.","October 10, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

The breakfast is great with a variety of foods to eat - pastries, yogurt, fruit, cheese, meat, etc. She also makes a delicous ham and cheese toast. You will feel so welcomed and happy staying there. Another plus is that it is close to the Saturday market. A must see in Prague. You can take a tram/boat to the market - which is so fun.","October 4, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

1106,"Of my current trip's accommodation, this place is the best. Best in cleanliness (spotless clean, likely one of cleanest in Europe and similar to the cleanest of Japanese standard), convenience (has all the basic amenities you need), location and most importantly the host Kristina. Location:Location is very convenient. 2min walk from Andrel station and 5min walk to the shopping complex with convenience stores. Location is not right smack in the middle of city but I'd prefer here as it is less noisy, less crowded yet within a manageable and walking distance to the city (est 20min) with nice view along the river. If you'd like to opt for metro/ tram, it has direct tram to Kampa, Mala Strana area (tram #2 I think), from which you can also walk to Prague castle.There is also direct tram to Letna park to view sunset (alight at ""sparta"" stop).There are many eateries near Andrel station, but I want to highlight a very affordable and nice Cezch restaurant which is 2min walk from the hotel (ask the host for directions)Cleanliness:Spotless clean - from toilet, kitchen, bed - perfectHost:Kristina is a very attentive and sincere host. She does her best to accommodate and answer any inquiries you might have, and serves very good breakfast too! There are many hotels with good services, but I think her sincerity and going the extra mile to service from the heart makes all the difference - it doesnt feel like a temporary place to sleep, it feels like home away from home. Will choose here anytime if I were to visit again.Stayed for 3 nights in September 2017","September 26, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

1108,"It's been a while since I wrote a review. I was compelled to shift away from my inertia because of my experience at Aparthotel and with Kristina. If I could convince Trip Advisor to skip straight from their 2018 award (Aparthotel is awarded this every year) and go straight to living sainthood, Kristina would be duly rewarded. My mother who also wrote a review, broke her foot at the end of our very first wonderful day (of a two week trip!). Simple freak fall on the cobblestones (helpful hint, wear sturdy shoes and be mindful! Nobody stares at their phones like they do in North America. Walking is the equivalent of driving stick - can't multitask!). Dusk made orienting ourselves difficult (we were almost back at Aparthotel, so well located in Prague) and I was loathe to roam as I hadn't yet found a SIM card. I got a hold of Kristina and she arrived like a superhero and arranged a taxi to take us to the hospital. She conveyed in Czech what was going on and made sure we were taken care of (wheelchair, triage, etc.). Suffice to say a heel break meant *zero* foot-floor contact. Side note - make sure you have comprehensive medical insurance (we did, thankfully) and avoid the public hospitals. Language is an issue and instead of a cast, we got crutches calibrated for a 5'9"" person (my mother, in her 70s, 5'4""), no lesson on how to use them and a free bonus lecture on the evils of capitalistic private health care. I'm Canadian and adore my socialized medicine, so tend to agree with this but in the case of Prague - you must opt for private. Kristina early the next day arranged to get a mini scooter that folded up so we could take taxis (not so easy to find!). She helped us adapt to this new reality always with her cheerful and practical optimism. She was determined to save our trip. She suggested accessible places to visit. When my mother developed an infection, she got us antibiotics and refused money. When we left our crutches at a restaurant one night (thankfully not too far) she hopped in her car to retrieve. Every self-perceived inconvenience thrown at her met with humour and kindness.Every time she heard us descend to leave for an outing or returning from an adventure, she would be there ready to help us in and out, or taking the scooter to recharge for the night. Ready, always ready - her gorgeous face and Cyndy Lauper hair became our patron saint. I'll leave it to others to describe the charm of the accommodation - homey, whimsical and lovely. Flooded with flowers, plants and an overall positive energy that contributes to a sense of community. The feeling contagious. Everyone chatting in her delightful kitchen. Nero her adorable Dachshund tootling for scraps... The spacious digs, everything one needs to live comfortably, even long-term... The fact you're in a residential hood living like a local, not 5 minutes from transit and a fully stocked mall with everything you need...That Kristina sits with you upon your arrival, no matter the time, with a smile and a refreshment and literally maps out everything you need to know. Arranges taxis to and from airport, rides, outings...We thought we had some special relationship with Kristina but then we witnessed so many hugs, so many gushing goodbyes... and of course this is why I selected her in the first place. 1,000+++ 5 * reviews. In this case, it's ok not to be ""special"", we are more than happy to share the love. Thank You dear Kristina for EVERYTHING <3","September 5, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

It must have been about 10 am when I was informed I had to leave and had to rush to pack everything while finding another hotel for that night. In a stroke of divine luck I found the hotel in question.I was expecting close to nothing, instead I was greeted by who is probably The Friendliest Woman in Prague. It was well over 11:30 and all guests had already had breakfast, but when I told her I hadn't had anything she proceeded to cook breakfast herself, just for me. While I was eating, she went out of her way to prepare my room (which I had booked just 45 minutes ago). The room was actually -as the name suggests- a nice, spacious and comfortable apartment. I got much more than I needed and expected.While the location is not right in the city's center, it is only a 20-minute walking distance from the castle and main square. In addition, the owner gave me close to 5 billion alternatives to the popular hotspots which were just as interesting and were not plagued with tourists. Just ask and you will learn about an old cemetery or a romantic themed walking itinerary.I am extremely thankful for feeling so well welcomed and treated.Btw, I'm sorry if this comes across as a very subjective personal experience, but said personal experience is all I can provide, and it was also excellent!Enjoy Prague :)","July 4, 2017","19    Aparthotel City 5

This one had plenty of soul, with its corridors that made you feel you were somehow in some old chateaux, and the rooms with quite a modern contrast; although small were comfortable and well designed. Nice arty touch with the theme of photo-paintings running through the common areas and rooms. Staff made all the difference. Lovely, warm, friendly attentive. Cosy little lobby lounge, although offering a limited array of coffees and snacks made to feel very homely by attentive staff. Felt very much at home during a week-long stay.

Close to Wenceslas Square (less than 5 minutes walk) and close to the river (about 10 minute stroll) and sandwiched between the main thoroughfares of Zitna and Jecna. So it's conveniently placed and the shuttle, a mini bus with two other couples took a little over thirty minutes to reach the hotel from the airport.Our welcome was warm and whilst completing out registration cards the receptionist provided coffee and cake for us. Perhaps we looked like we needed it after a very early start to catch the flight. We had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, however it was well appointed, spotlessly clean and very comforatble.Breakfast was a wide choice of continental and hot food with plenty of fruit and cereals available. Juice, coffee and choice of teas.The double bed had two single duvets, which threw us a bit and the only English language TV channels were BBC World News and if I recall correctly CNN, but that wasn't a big deal.What else is there to say, friendly staff, good accommodation, excellent location and the food was plentiful and delicious.","January 4, 2018","20    1.Republic

The taxi fare is 650kč, about 40 min from airport to old town. Although our taxi has minor crashed by another careless driver in front of the hotel but this didn’t spoil our holiday mood.When we arrived at the hotel, we were welcomed with hot tea/coffee and homemade cake. The receptionist Alisa is very friendly and helpful. She gave us a very good suggestion for sightseeing Prague city with 2 young kids and save our money.

The hotel has prepared a Rosé wine for my husband birthday and the housekeeper is very friendly and thoughtful, she left some candy and a little bear keychain for my children after cleaning our room.

Front desk woman was curt and cold and not very welcoming. I felt that she wanted us out of her way . Even with giving directions she just gave us a map that was pre- marked on hotel's location.

1175,"We have just returned from this hotel and would highly recommend it It was very relaxing after busy days in Prague .We were visiting our daughter on a university exchange programme and it was walking distance to her accommodation.Breakfast was nice ,room large and as previously stated a fantastic pick up service to and from metro however using bus 201 and 112 will also take you near to the hotel.Used the hotel pool sauna jacuzzi most days and had it to ourselves very clean and nice.The hotel wifi did not work too well but not a real issue for us personally.Looking forward to a Spring visit as some nice outdoor space to sit in bar /gardens and a crazy golf course plus bowling.Very helpful kind staff and a great ambiance.We didn't travel with young children but a fantastic little playground loads of equipment for them Thanks a great stay ","November 28, 2018","21    Castle Residence Praha

1176,Stayed for 2 nights during first visit to Prague. Hotel is in a quiet residential area and has private parking which means you don’t have to be confused by fighting with trams etc. Hotel offers a free shuttle service on request including pick ups until 11pm...they will organise tickets for anything you want to see and offer plenty of advice. Really friendly place with comfortable rooms..has a pool and sauna but we didn’t use it. Great stay ,"September 3, 2018","21    Castle Residence Praha

The hotel is situated away from the centre up a hill, but they offer a free minibus service whenever required down to the nearest tram stop from where it's only a few stops to the centre.

1181,"We were most pleased by this hotel! We had a family room which was basically a small apartment. Two very large separate rooms with a bathroom. Just amazing when you have two doors separating you and your children for a good night sleep and still have a comfortable, homey feeling. Their shuttle service is also great. It takes you to the zoo and back, or a nearby metro station if you want to visit Prague and you can leave your car there safe. The driver of the shuttle was super friendly and with the biggest smile. We also played a game of their adventure mini golf which was also very amusing. The restaurant was also pleasing with a lovely terrace and little playground. Basically , a very lovely hotel and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Prague and still enjoy a little peace and quiet.","August 3, 2017","21    Castle Residence Praha

1182,"We have stayed at this hotel three times over the past couple of months and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The first time we were a bit dubious as the hotel is outside of the city but the friendliness of the staff made up for this and the fact that the mini bus was willing to take you to the nearest Metro or tram stop and pick you up again. The ride into the centre of Prague was relaxing and entering the city from a different direction makes you realise the splendour of the place.The rooms are clean, comfortable and well air conditioned. The beds are also comfortable and extra pillows are available upon request.The breakfast in the adjoining restaurant is good but not an excessive choice and again you are given a smiling welcome. The lunch time menu changes everyday and is very good value for money.The evening menu is limited and needs to be updated on a more regular basis as is becomes monotonous if your are staying more than a few days.The laundry service is same day and the bags are iron and non iron. No clothes were returned that had been washed at too high a temperature and prices reasonable.We would recommend the garden BBQ held through Thurs. to Sunday. Great food in an enjoyable garden setting.The hotel is not too far from the Zoo, well worth a visit, and the Botanical gardens and again the mini bus will take you to both sites.The wifi is a bit slow although it has been upgraded but just be patient. There is also limited English Channels on the TV but not a major disaster.Thanks Konrad and your staff for making our stay so enjoyable. Recommending to friends who are considering visiting Prague.","June 25, 2017","21    Castle Residence Praha

They offered a shuttle service to the nearest tram and metro free of charge and that simplified things a lot. They also had a phone number and would come pick you up after. The room was phenomenal for the price, and the location was perfect. Not to close to the city, not too far away. The sauna and hot tub were nice, and the pool was clean and refreshing. The bottom line is the staff were willing to help you do whatever it took to make you happy. I was sick and they offered to drive me to the pharmacy to get some meds.

1187,We are a family of 5 and throughly enjoyed our time in Prague. Prague is very charming and it captured all of our hearts.Castle Residence was perfect for us. We were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. The residence itself is quirky but good.It's situated in a quiet residential area.Our family room was spacious and clean.Breakfast each morning was good.We used the indoor pool at the end of each day. There is a small bowling alley within which we also played at night.Outside is a little park where the kids can play and run around. An outdoor seating area also where you can have a bit to eat or a drink whilst watching the kids play.Every morning the owners shuttled us for free to the underground station. We were also picked up on return. This was so helpful and convenient for all of us.The tube ride into the centre of Prague was not that long. Maybe 10/15 mins ?We spent most days in the city exploring and enjoying the beauty.We highly recommend the Segway tours. A great fun way to see the city and hear about the history.No complaints. Really enjoyed our stay here.,"February 18, 2016","21    Castle Residence Praha

1189,"Very difficult to find-in the middle of a mixture of high rise apartments, commercial buildings and private homes. Not an easy review to write so I will set it out as follows.1) First room we were allocated was dark and dingy- lots of wood felt like a coffin with a large a/c unit hanging from the ceiling. Meant to be a double room but, was 2 single beds side by side with a large gap down the centre.2) 2nd room was nice, quite large with balcony and terrace which was very acceptable. Still 2 beds side by side apparently Hotel has only 1 room with a double bed so web site is confusing. Hotel in general appeared to be run by Gentlemen and so it lacked a ""womans"" finesse eg no room or shelf for toiletries in the bathroom. Very useful that it had a mini fridge and kettle for tea making although it had no English breakfast tea -just green or earl grey. Room had 1 bottle of water which I would expect in a single room so for a double 2 bottles of water expected.3) We arrive down for breakfast 10 mins before the cut off time. It was very dis jointed had to ask for cups/ glasses/ cutlery etc. Very limited on what was on offer but, perhaps that how it is in general in Prague.4) The leisure area is very basic and un -inviting in its décor and ambiance. It appears to be totally geared up for kids as every morning when one would normally like to swim it was full of parents and kids!!!! No where on the web site did I see that children appeared to have priority on the use of the pool with swimming lessons taking place!!! 5) As mentioned earlier the Owner and most of the staff are very friendly and could not do enough to help. The restaurant staff not so good and could do with guest relation training. The shuttle bus is a fantastic service to offer and I think without it guests would find the Hotel far too difficult and out of the way for sight-seeing and visiting the centre of Prague.6) Very disappointed on our return from sight seeing that we could not get a nightcap as a resident the bar closed at 11 pm. To me this is always a perfect end to a days sightseeing and enjoyment. Never ever stayed in a hotel which did not offer a bar service to residents and certainly not what I would have expected to find in Prague generally, as drinking seems to be encouraged and in some establishments it was cheaper than having a soft drink.","May 29, 2015","21    Castle Residence Praha

1190,"We choose that hotel because it lays a little to the north of Praha, closer to the Airport - we didn't want to go into Praha for just one night. However on our way to the hotel we were not always sure if we were on the correct road - if road is not too much. However when we arrived, we found a good parking (for free!) and a well maintained building. After our uncomplicated reception, we were brought to our rooms ... the way there was split. In some parts it was very nice, beautifully decorated with inlays in the floor and in the next you stood in a empty, cold aisle with stains and marks on the walls. The room was spacious the bed was good and the bathroom wonderful - however the layout and design of the room at more than a hint of minimalistic design. Still, there was a mini-bar and a desk with free WLAN.After a very quiet night we got a delicious breakfast which was wonderfully laid out (at the cheese platter I even I second thoughts about taking one of the slices because they were so well arranged).The juice was good but the coffee / tea was average from a very simple automate...I can see why some people would give it an excellent but actually for my taste there were just a hint too many stains and the surround, yeah, I wouldn't take a walk around the hotel unless I stayed in the nice gardens. The complementary shuttle to downtown Praha is very kind and we were tempted for a short moment but then decided otherwise and go to the Restaurant in the Hotel.","March 5, 2015","21    Castle Residence Praha

1193,"I stayed at this hotel for 9 weeks and 1 day. The manager, Konrad, was excellent and responded immediately to all requests. The hotel is in a quieter part, just outside Prague. The area is known as the 'garden' area and this is lovely if one wants to go into and out of the centre (very easy… trams 12 and 24 go into and out of each half of the city). The hotel offers lifts to and from the nearby tram stop and also to local areas of interest like DOX, local restaurants, or the National Gallery. (free). The rooms are well equipped and the service standards excellent. There are a few amenities, like a small swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna, but Prague is probably too lovely to spend too much time indoors. The hotel has a restaurant (outside catering) which is good. I found all the staff helpful, friendly, professional and caring. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who does not want to be smack bang in a tourist area but who would like to see more of Prague itself. I did use the 'garden area'.

Pool and sauna added bonus after sightseeing etc. The shuttle to tram is great, a truly personal service. Staff very friendly and helpful. Tram 15 mins to centre, cheap, frequent, shuttle back immediate if rung ahead.Strongly recommended, as the cost for this is much less than it would be in most cities, never mind capital cities.

You order something and they don't remember.At the breakfast I was alone eating 10 minutes after finish and was forced to immediately leave, because in 50 minutes they need to ""open restaurant for people"". I asked several times if I can finish my food and was told, no, you must leave now, breakfast time finished - we need to clean. What?!It was like I have personally insulted her by not finishing breakfast on time. For hundredths of hotels I've been before - this is the first time I've got such intentionally rude service.Aside from this - no king size beds, hard mattress, no slippers, safe box not working, design of rooms is strange, tv on the side of bed, open electric plug at the head on the bed, carton walls so you hear everyone movements and talks.Aside from the fact that it's extremely far away from the center despite how it looks. And I have a rented car...It's my number 7 hotel in Prague - big drop in quality.

The hotel did provide a free shuttle to the tram or bus stop, which was helpful, but it still took 45 mins to get from the centre of town to the hotel. The hotel is in a residential area so there is nothing to walk round or do once at the hotel - although they do have a nice swimming pool.

Special thanks to Jan for his advice.The breakfast was good and plenty of choice, buffet style food & hot drinks so you could have as little or as much as you wanted. Long availability of breakfast was also good so early or late starters. The building and rooms are immaculate, spacious and the cleanliness of the highest standards. Not a critism, but a suggestion for the future - for us we would have liked to have been able to get snacks or light meals at the hotel rather than just the full restaurant menu.

We arrived quite late on our arrival day (11pm) even that guy from the reception came to tune our TV as was in Russian language and none of us understood single word. Great! Our guests came over next couple of days. We have had quite few children so playroom and bowling were very handy to keep them engaged. Except one night out we were having our dinners in hotel. Ohhhh soooo yummy! Everything we have had there was delicious! Breakfast gives you a nice choice too.On the wedding day best man has found he has white shoelaces in black shoes!!! `No worries` said bartender and gave him his own. Fab! I have to say all members of staff were very friendly and willing to do anything to make you happy which we think was one of the reasons why our wedding was so great!Overall...rooms are very nice and clean. Whatever you need just call reception and they will bring it to you with smile on face no matter what time. Food...loved it a lot!

Probably less than a UK pub (although I haven't lived in UK for 6 years).An extra welcome activity is the bars' en-suite 10 pin bowling alley (2 lanes). Again, these were always available and very reasonably priced.I think there is also minigolf at the back, but this was closed in the cold days of February.If I could think of something bad about this place, I would tell you, but I can't.......hang on.......nope! Not a thing.OK, the views are not inspiring and it's not bang in the centre, but for the service, quality and value, you would find it hard to beat the Castle Residence Hotel.We paid 500€ for 4 nights which included the breakfast. The pool is free to use. We had two evening meals with beer, wine soft drinks. Countless games of bowling and lots of tram tickets.Total bill was 611€..I'll throw some pictures on here later - watch this space.","February 7, 2013","21    Castle Residence Praha

1205,"My husband and I took our 13year old grandson for a half term holiday break. The Castle residence were offering a package at that time which included tickets to the zoo, bicycle hire, ten pin bowling session and soft drinks from the fridge. Excellent value for money.The hotel was impressive, a lovely quiet location. Our bedrooms were intercommunicating, large and neatly furnished. The rural location meant we were some distance from the centre of the city but the hotel provided a very efficient taxi service which took us to either the metro station or tram and from either we could reach the city centre, the metro being the quickest 10mins, the city stop meant a good walk to Charles bridge, the tram being overland took a little longer but stopped close to Charles Bridge. A quick phone call to the hotel on return for taxi service. Breakfast in the hotel taken in a very light and pleasant dining room with a delightful outlook was excellent. We had a very enjoyable dinner one evening,good choice on the menu and the prices were fair. This is a hotel we would like to stay in again in the summertime as the garden patio surrounded by well cared for borders would be a very nice place to relax and enjoy peace and quiet after a lively day in the beautiful city of Prague. We could not find any fault with our stay,all the staff were very pleasant and obliging, we would certainly recommend The Castle Residence. Many thanks to them all for a most memorable and enjoyable experience","November 19, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

1206,"We saw some nice reviews for this hotel and we realy wanted to stay in this hotel during our visit to Prague. We wanted to stay for four nights but they did not have any avalible room for all nights of our stay. Their staff have made considerable efforts and on the end they have found a solution. Hura for them and a great news for us.Hotel is not in the center of Prague, but don't worry, they have a solution for everything. First they have a great, safe and free parking. Their shuttle bus will take you to the tram and you will be in center of Prague in 15 min.. Totally cool service. When you come back, they will pick you up at the tram station and take you back to hotel. Rooms are nice and clean, staff is ultra helpful and friendly. They also have a nice restaurant where they serve good breakfast. We also had dinner once and it was excellent to. Sauna and pool is great after a long walk in Prague, so use it. :)The price was realy good because you have a great service, parking, sauna & pool, breakfast and shuttle transfers in the price. Totally cool hotel. The only bad thing was the WIFI...It worked, but was slow and the signal in our room was not so good. Nevertheless, we had a great time in this hotel.","November 4, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

1207,"As a previous reviewer said, it was a little odd getting to the hotel on a few different side streets, but it is in a great location if you don't want to be in the center of the city with all the noise and parking hassles. The hotel will literally take care of your every need. We had a 3 day holiday where they booked a massage for my husband and I on short notice, always were available to take us to the tram (and had the tickets there for the tram). The restaurant had a great breakfast in the morning with lots of variety for hot and cold options as well as pastries/fruit and the lunch/evening entrees were delicious as well. The room we had was pretty large and had a balcony with the bed being the usual or Europeans in that it was a double bed- two single beds together, though the comforters/pillows were super comfortable. It isn't absolute luxury like your staying at a Hilton, but very personable, clean, and a place to relax- but still see the heart of Prague. Also if you get a chance- check out the Folklore Dance, super fun and by far the best night that we had while staying in Prague.","September 12, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

1209,"I recently spent a week at the hotel and had a great time. I found the hotel very nice and a spectacular deal. The staff were always very accommodating and extremely helpful, whether with their courtesy pick-ups/drop-offs at the local tram stop or metro stop, having mass transit tickets available for when you head out, finding a restaurant we didn't have the address for, or providing other random answers. We had a double room, which was quite large by most European rooms I'd ever stayed in, however maintaining the standard pressed together double bed arrangement. Each bed still had it's own blanket too. This could be a benefit if the person sharing your bed tends to use more than their half of a bedspread. There were no extra pillows/blankets in the room but I'm sure the staff would accommodate if you asked. I would say the general decoration of the hotel is clean, feeling of higher end Ikea.Mini-fridge was stocked with beverages and a couple snacks with prices prominently indicated. They appeared to be sticker price and not raised to excessive levels.We ate dinner twice at the hotel, and had coffee/drinks on two other afternoons. Each meal was very good and equally well priced. My first was a really memorable confit of rabbit, with a parsnip mash. Never having rabbit this way before I was really, really, pleased with the sheer succulence of the meat, as well as the intense flavor of it, reminding me of what I wished a Thanksgiving turkey actually tasted like. When I ordered it the waitress informed me that was a common Czech dish-which I confirmed later throughout the week after seeing it or a version of it, on many other menus. To note, the hotel is not at all in or near the city center. It isn't even a quick walk from the pretty excellent mass transit available in Prague. It is in a purely residential area on the periphery of Prague. They are about 5 minutes or less from a tram stop which will have you in Old Town in less than 15 minutes. Getting back at the end of the night was always more complicated, we were usually looking for the #17 tram, and occasionally misread the schedule, having to transfer at a stop or backtrack. The front desk is occupied 24hrs a day and was able to resolve any doubts though-even picking us up a little after their 2300 cut-off time. There is parking for the hotel if you rent a car at some point, like I did. They also have free WiFi-though I didn't use it not having a computer on my trip.The hotel appears very child friendly and over the course of our week we noticed most occupants were families.","August 21, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

Clean swimmingpool and we had a large familyroom for two adults en two kids, large tv and three windows with a view over the garden. With sauna, small whirlpool with music!, bowling, children playroom, good food and friendly service. Very good for families with kids.","August 12, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

1211,"In our travels, it is seldom that you stumble on a hotel that: 1) customer service and hospitality are truly first and genuine 2) You feel at home even when the home and the home is both chic and classy 3) You are presented excellent value for money. Castle Residence is without a doubt an excellent hotel, one that I can't just say enough good things about. The staff is sincere, professional and go out of their way to insure you are treated with five star hospitality when you are paying substantially less. This is one of those hotels that you will be reading about in Conde Nast or some other well heeled travel magazine that will be touting it as a must to stay at. While you won't find door men and superfluous staff, what you get in return is a visit to a hotel where the rooms are nicely appointed, common areas that make you feel like you are visiting a part of the past, a restaurant that is good value for money and sense that you are in your house and not a hotel. This is definitely not some cookie cutter hotel or high brow bed-n-breakfast where customer service comes second. While you are in Prague (East Side by the Zoo) you are close enough to everything because of the shuttle that Hotel provides to a near by Tram Stop. If you want to try something different, try this hotel, you won't be sorry.","May 20, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

1212,"Gorgeous hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff. Really made us feel we were living in luxury for a few days. We happened to go in off season, which meant we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves, including the pool and sauna area, which was very relaxing. The room was fantastic, spacious, clean and very classy. Only downside is the location, which is out of the city centre. However the hotel staff had no problem in transferring us to any local stations. Its only because we had a couple of late nights that it made it a bit more difficult to get back, but this was our choice. Definitely recommend this place for a romantic city break. Prague is awesome too.","January 23, 2012","21    Castle Residence Praha

I have stayed in many hotels before but never one that is so friendly attentative to detail friendly staff beyond anything i would of imagined.The restaurant is fine dining at sensibl prices, a meal for 2 didnt set us back any more than £20 and that included drinks. the bar prices were also sensible meaning you cuold enjoy a relaxing meal and after meal drink in the bar without the fear of a hefty Bill at the end of your stay.The facilities are well equipped, and although it is out of town getting to town is not an issue with regualr tram links and a complimentary shuttle service provided by the hotel to tram stops. The tickets are sold in reception for the tram and the ride is approximately 10 mins into town. Parking is free on site so it is a great find if you are travelling by car.

1214,"We recently stayed in Castle Residence Praha in Prague. This hotel opened in April 2011 and everything is brand new. Our room was huge and could easily fit two normal hotel rooms. The room offers comfortable beds, a nice sitting area, large flatscreen TV, tea-making facilities and a spacious bathroom. The people running the hotel do their utmost to make you feel comfortable (and they succeed). Breakfast is good and the restaurant offers a small menu but with tasty and well made dishes. The outside terrace in the garden was very nice.The hotel is situated in a residencial area just outside the city centre of Prague. Trams 14 and 17 take you to the city centre in approx. 15 min. We didn't mind the fact of just being outside the city centre; unless you are in the very heart of the city (and are willing to pay the price) you will always have to travel within the city as well. We found that the transportation to and from the city (the hotel offers free shuttle rides to and from the tram stop (or bus stop) was as easy as being in the city itself. We would certainly choose this hotel again when travelling to Prague.","September 15, 2011","21    Castle Residence Praha

Only fruit teas provided in room so bring your own tea bags and longlife milk if you like your morning cuppa, as we do! There was, a fridge in our room. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Wenceslas Sq and Old Town and there are plenty of eateries in the area. The ""pub"" across the road from the hotel serves good basic food and tasty Prague beer on tap. The only problem we had was that we were not able to leave our suitcases at the hotel for the day when we checked out (we had a late flight back to Heathrow so had some hours to kill before our taxi was due). The hotel will look after your cases for a couple of hours max but do not have proper storage facilities for looking after luggage in these circumstances. The manager told us we could leave our cases at nearest railway station for a small charge but in the end we found a local youth hostel through Bagbnb.com that looked after our cases for 5 euros for the day.

The Old Town is also only about a 15 minute pleasant stroll from the hotel.To get to our rooms (which were in the other wing), we had to climb half a flight of stairs as our floor wasn't fully serviced by the lift which was a little bit difficult with heavy luggage. Our rooms were basically furnished and clean but had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. The best thing about the rooms were the lovely, large marble bathrooms. There is a courtyard between the reception wing and our wing, which was a lovely place to sit and relax.The hotel is modern and stylish and features marble floors in the public areas and has a nice sense of space.

1227,"I had done a thorough search for accommodation in Prague as many accommodation prices were cheaper than what I was used to in Western Europe.I can certainly say that this was the right choice!The hotel is on a quiet street just 1km from central station and it is quite easy to walk there. The hotel is also about 1km or a 10 minute walk from one of the main streets (Vaclavske Namesti) that eventually leads into the old town if you follow it straight down. The hotel felt new, it was bright with high ceilings, and modern. I loved how, what I assume was a previous older building, was minimalistically merged into a fresh, modern hotel. It was also very spacious and very clean. The hotel personnel has done an outstanding job in terms of cleaning. It was also very quiet! The hotel room was spacious. We stayed here with 3 adults and were never in each other’s way or stepping on top of luggage. The bathroom was perfect: new, lots of towels and a great shower. The beds were comfortable (with crisp white sheets!) and big. There were 3 windows in the room bringing lots of light even with the room facing the court yard. We didn’t have breakfast included but decided to have it in the hotel anyways. A good variety of bread with choices of meat, cheese, yogurt, pancakes, cereal, boiled eggs, fruit. It’s a simple breakfast but certainly sufficient to get your day started. It is buffet style so you can easily load up on the fresh carbs. The hotel staff was very friendly!! I was pleasantly surprised as I had left my expectation for customer service at the airport. But arriving at H7 and checking in was a breeze and we were welcomed and treated with the utmost friendliness and respect. [In regards to the general customer service, anyone visiting from Western Europe or North America will need to lower their expectation. People there interact differently with the customer, eye contact and smiling varies in every country. You may perceive it as rude, but just perceive it as different and don’t take it personally.]To get to the hotel we took the Airport Express bus from the airport to the main train station. This was cheap and easy. At the airport, you can buy bus tickets in terminal one at the tourist information desk (not at the kiosk for other local busses, metro or tram). At the train station you can buy the AE bus ticket at the domestic bus/train counter. ","August 20, 2018","22    MH Suites Palace

1233,"Loved the place from the moment we arrived. Lovely lady on reception who was really helpful and accommodating. Our room was lovely, warm and clean. Nice and big and tastefully decorated. In terms of location, it’s a walk to all the tourist attractions but we didn’t mind that and got up our daily steps!! H7 is close to the shops and some lovely restaurants...Googlemaps was our best friend!Breakfast had the potential to be great but by the time we got down for breakfast (usually 9ish) a lot of it was dried out or cold. That would be my only ‘room for improvement’ point. On the whole, we had a wonderful stay at H7 for my 40th birthday! Would definitely recommend.","April 9, 2018","22    MH Suites Palace

1235,"This was a surprisingly cheap 3 night stay at the end of February as a couple. Firstly, there was good communication from the hotel before arrival, one email offered a prebooked taxi from the airport which we decided to use. A taxi was waiting for us at a cost of €25 or equivalent Czech price. Upon arrival at H7 we were buzzed into a vast clean and white hallway. Check in was quick with multilingual friendly reception staff who were happy to talk through a city map for you to get your city bearings. The room was ready early a perk of booking with Secret Escapes. The aparthotel is very airy with high ceilings parquet floors and is clean and quiet. The room we chose was a classic room - we chose this room as we didn't intend to spend much time in it so didn't need a suite. That said, the room was large with a sofa a large comfortable bed plus a beautiful big modern bathroom with a rainforest shower. There was also air conditioning which we didn't need. In addition, the room was quiet as was the street. We were very pleased with our room choice. Breakfast was included in our rate, it was served in a bright clean basement with arched ceilings. There was plenty of continental food on offer such as hams, pastries, cereals yoghurts etc. The hotels location was in a nondescript side street about 10 minutes easy walk from Wensleslas square. Upon checkout H7 had a secure luggage room for your cases. We also booked another taxi. To sum up, a great modern boutique aparthotel in a fabulous city as a great price.","March 4, 2018","22    MH Suites Palace

1239,"We stayed 7 nights at the H7 Palace. Reception is open form 8 am to 8 pm so if you're checking-in late send and email to the hotel so they can arrange for your room ahead of time. The H7 Palace is composed of 2 buildings, the main one through the main entrance and the second one through the courtyard.The rooms are a good size and updated. Although the toilet paper is like sand paper. You have a convenience store just next to the hotel so you can get some there. The safe in the room is a bit complicated to operate it so ask the reception desk for some help (not like the typical one you usually find).Breakfast is good with a good variety. They don't put enough cold cuts on the plates and they are very slow to fill them back but in general the service is good. If you ask them, they can make you scrambled eggs from the kitchen.The hotel is very well located in the new town and is close to 2 metro stations. The area is safe and you even have 2 small bars on the other side of the street of the hotel.","October 4, 2017","22    MH Suites Palace

The bed was comfortable and they even had a bidet. If you require an iron you have to request one as they are not automatically in the room. The room was very quiet. It is a little out of the way but still in the old town, so wear good walking shoes. The tram is on the next street over. We felt safe but I would not like to walk alone at night.

1242,"The entire building is nicely redone and the rooms plus entrance etc all look nice, new and good. Downsides for me: they have kept (or redone) the beautiful old doors to the rooms, but these, unfortunately are not sound proof and also otherwise you can hear people in the rooms next door more than in a hotel. That can be quite disturbing when they come home after you and talk (even at a normal level).Breakfast: no bad, not great, but very friendly waiter and breakfast service. Service otherwise is limited, there is one person only there at the reception (leaving at 8 p.m. - if you check in after that, you get a code, worked fine for me).Real downside in my view is the location: it is still central, but not super central and while the street itself is quiet, the area is not. If you walk back from the center at night you come accross a red-light zone with the corresponding men around...","August 3, 2017","22    MH Suites Palace

The hotel was modern and clean and quiet even though one of the busiest roads was near. The customer service was really friendly and helpful :) The room was nice and clean but it was a bit hot in the room even though we had our air condition on all the time the lowest you can get it. Also the breakfast wasn't worth for 7€ it was quite poor - with that price we would have get a big brunch in some other cafe or so... But after all the visit in H7 Palace was good I would recommend it if you are looking for a bit more quiet hotel and area.

At first curious whether the place was a bit far out we found that it was really nice to stay bit out of the crowded, touristy area. It's very easy to travel by public transport or walk in 10 / 15 minutes to the center. We had a very good experience at H7. Very clean, very neat, and the staff was friendly.

1249,"Overall we found the H7 to be poor value, given by the nearly complete lack of service- which was unexpected. The front desk is staffed by a single person, who is frequently absent, only until 8pm. There are no phones in the rooms, so the only way to contact this single staff person is to go to the desk and hope they are there. We were here for 3 nights, and housekeeping did not service our room once. We inquired after the first day and were told they only come every second day, but in our case that didn't happen either. We did ask for and get additional towels, but of course didn't think to ask, and therefore didn't get refills on the in room water and instant coffee. Because there is no restaurant or room service (yet) that meant we couldn't even manage a coffee in room. We stayed in the family suite, which worked well for sleeping arrangements - but wasn't really a space you could hang out in. The lack of service and attention to detail extended to the small courtyard, which had enormous potential, and most nights has several guests outside enjoying it, however all forced to sit on the wicker seats without cushions, which were there on day one, but never reappeared.So, minor details, maybe, but for what you pay, I'm certain you can do better in Prague- we paid hotel rates for what was essentially and under equipped apartment.

As with everywhere we’ve been in Europe so far the coffee is the weak spot, but it is drinkable. Someone here as a fetishising with water wheels, but that is really a nice quirk.

The small courtyard with the mill-wheel is a very pleasant centerpiece to the building. The food in the restaurant is AWESOME (although not cheap), the breakfast is every day the same, but the selection of foods is wide so even on longer stay one does not get bored.Service - the staff in both hotel and restaurant is extremely pleasant and helpful, competent and professional.

They are communicating well in English, Czech, and German, they were even walking the extra mile to greet us in Polish.Location - the hotel is placed in a quiet part of Prague - its location may be a drawback to some since it is not near the center, but the public transport connection is very good, a bus stop is right in front of the hotel with just a few stops to get to the subway (it takes 20-30 minutes to the center depending on the time and day of week).

To vše jsme našli v hotelu Selský Dvůr a naše svatba se ukázala úžasně.Personál je velmi zkušený v organizaci svateb a samotný hotel je pro takovou akci skvělý, díky vnitřním a venkovním prostorám nabízí variantu pro každé počasí.Restaurace nám připravila výborný oběd a večeři formou rautu pro společnost 30ti lidí, a personál byl vždy milý a profesionální.Zvláštní poděkování patří panu Dvorskému, který nám pomohl celou akci uspořádat a byl vždy neuvěřitelně vstřícný a trpělivý k našim nekončícím otázkám a požadavkům. Děkujeme!","September 5, 2017","23    Hotel Selsky Dvur

It's an excellent bet if you have a rental car and don't mind a short drive.We stayed one night in this hotel to bridge the gap between our travel plans and the start of a work-related trip.We arrived late and were greeted by very friendly staff who advised us to quickly grab dinner in the restaurant, since the kitchen was about to close. The waiter suggested two excellent dishes and we were served promptly. The meal was great -- it was among the best Czech meals we had on our trip.By the time we were done with dinner, the kind receptionist had checked us into our room. The rooms have been recently re-done, with granite countertops, fancy showers. Everything was impeccably clean. The only down-side is that the wi-fi didn't work in our room.The free breakfast in the morning was the best free breakfast I've had in any hotel, anywhere. There was organic loose-leaf tea, coffee, pastries, scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit -- everything you could want. All of it was delicious. This place is a little bit off the beaten track, but in tourist season, in Prague, I think that's a good thing. If you have a car, it's easy to drive from here to downtown, and it's worth making the trek.I wish we'd stayed here for the entire duration of our trip!","August 29, 2016","23    Hotel Selsky Dvur

So I had very high expectations, but this is just a nice normal hotel, far away from city center, not worth more than 80 euro a night. They say they have some special mattresses and pillows, maybe that's why the price before the discount was so high... :) They blocked some money on my account when I made the reservation. At check-out they asked for the full amount, I asked about the blocked amount, they said it will be unblocked.

1298,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Selsky Dvur (pronounced as in “moor”) and it is challenging to best express how much we enjoyed our visit – from 21 to 25 September. This cosy, relatively small (30 bedroomed) hotel is perfect for anyone looking for a relaxing and tranquil experience, we never heard any noise and, apart from when we were dining, we felt we were the only guests. Our delightful ground floor room was simply amazing as was the view to the rear looking out onto a stream with ducks and an inviting park land just beyond. Like other recent reviewers, we also found the beds so comfortable and incredibly soothing; we normally rise early but found ourselves rushing to appear for breakfast shortly before the 10 a.m. deadline. The reception area is staffed 24/7 and special mention has to be made to the 3 extremely efficient and friendly young ladies behind the desk whom we got to know – Andrea, Jana and Gabriel - who were always smiling and eager to give assistance.  We had evening dinner on two occasions at the hotel during our stay and strongly commend the menu and the very high quality of cooking by an award winning chef; we thought the selection of food extensive and inexpensive (resident guests are given a 15% discount); the table service was excellent.The wellness centre is relatively small and quite intimate but ideal as it can only be used privately by individual guest couples/families; it is kept spotlessly clean and hygienic. Bookings are normally required at least 1 hour beforehand to allow the sauna and heated relaxation benches to warm up. There is a special type of foot bath which I didn’t use as it was not familiar. One evening I enjoyed an hour long candle lit relaxation massage from a petite and very pleasant masseuse called Renata, highly recommendable - especially after a day walking the cobbled streets of Old Town ! Although Hotel Selsky Dvur is located away from the popular tourist areas, I strongly believe the benefits of a quiet and safe neighbourhood far outweigh the small inconvenience of having to avail of a bus and metro journey. On a couple of days we twice commuted back and forth into the city, once in the morning and again in the early evening, not a problem. Travelling around beautiful Prague is child’s play, so simple – from the hotel it takes about 7 minutes on a 177 bus then 14 minutes on the (Green) A Line Metro to the area (Stare Mesto) of the Charles Bridge. Cheap 24 hour and 72 hour tickets can be bought at the reception desk and must be stamped on the first journey only, thereafter they allow total unlimited hop on, hop off freedom on buses, trams and metro, forget them but keep safely in pocket/wallet.We would certainly choose to return to the Selsky Dvur.","September 29, 2015","23    Hotel Selsky Dvur

Ewww, 40 to 60 minute public transport commute to city centre (includes time waiting for Bus 177 especially at night) - advertising gave the impression that hotel was only 20 minutes away from the city centre. So very misleading, Good Points: Modern decor of room, quiet and reserved feel to the premises, Enjoyed the attic windows and the natural ventilation when relocated from the smelly left wing on the ground floor, Nice and modern bathroom with shower, Helpful staff, Quaint courtyard, Enjoyed the duck and cranberry cabbage dinner and ordered it on both nights, All in all, Prague was a very stunning city and we had an amazing time!","September 11, 2015","23    Hotel Selsky Dvur

So the announcement of sleeping comfort mentioned on the website becomes true.Bus is in front of the hotel and tramway (I think longest line in Prague - directly to the city and also through the city up to Hradcany) is just 5 minutes walk from hotel. Taking the Tram is as good as making a sightseeing tour. On-site parking is available.

One of the best parts of our hotel stay was the delicious, truly continental breakfast with bread, crusty buns, cheeses, cold cuts, herring, salads, eggs, bacon, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit and vegetables, coffee, tea and delicious cakes.To get to downtown Prague, you catch a bus right in front of the hotel, and transfer a few stops later to the subway. A seamless experience. A day pass for the bus and subway is around $5.50 CAN. There is a mall close by (10 minute walk) which has a supermarket. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but we did not try it.","September 16, 2014","23    Hotel Selsky Dvur

1310,"Booked the apartment because it was based in old town Prague. What a lovely hidden treasure it is. Entrance is through a small door that you would never know was there into a delightful building with little courtyard in the centre. We were in Apartment E on the 2nd floor so there were a quite a few stairs to climb with no lift access (some of the apartments can be reached by the lift) It’s an apartment for 2 people but could sleep three as there is a sofa bed in the living room area. Modern inside and impeccably clean. Has a washing machine, dishwasher, integrated fridge, cooker, microwave, kettle and toaster (coffee maker too!) and all kitchen utensils. It was stocked with kitchen towel, washing up liquid and cloths. The living area had comfy armchair and hugs sofa as well as TV and WiFi router. Bed was a little low to get in and out of (for me personally) but it was comfortable enough (extra pillows available in cupboard too). The bathroom was large, but a little dated, and the shower head wasn’t the greatest, but I’ve seen much worse on my travels. The only down side is that they aren’t serviced and towels aren’t changed (or bins removed) but we just washed them ourselves so not a big issue as we were only here 4 nights. Lovely welcoming staff and you feel secure as the desk is constantly manned. Great location and would definitely recommend! Thanks UKapra for a lovely stay! Will definitely return again!

You need to put a €400 deposit for any damage that might be made. Looking at the state of the apartment, i think i should be given cash rebates for having to stay in the apartment with the damages!!

We even had a roof terrace, which was nice.We ordered airport transportation to the town at the same time we booked the apartment. The driver was especially nice and told us a lot about the town and the history of the country.The reception was in the other building across the street, so by the arrival we were told to go there, the receptionists in the main building spoke english, but the receptionist (an older man) in the other building didn´t speak english at all and couldn´t even told us on what floor our apartment was.We order a breakfast basket to our room for one morning, although there are nice places near to have a breakfast.The contents of the basket were good, but it was delivered to us so late that we had already had a breakfast at a nearby restaurant at that time.","November 28, 2018","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

1317,"This was our first visit to Prague and we decided to find somewhere in Old Town. The U Kapra building is right in the middle of all the Old Town bustle which, after a few days got a little tiresome as it was so crowded. And it is quiet season! Next time, I would stay either on the outskirts near New Town or across the Charles Bridge in Little Quarter. Restaurants nearby are good but expensive compared to other parts of the city. We booked ‘Lovely’ apartment which is 1 bathroom and 2 bedrooms, both of Which are loft-style and reached via their own staircase, one of which is more like a ladder. The two bedrooms are open to the living room and each other so, if you like privacy, chose another apartment. This may seem like a small complaint, but I did give myself a headache by bumping into the roof beams a few times in the night, heading downstairs to the loo! And we found the bedding too hard and pillows way too soft so it was hard to get a solid night’s sleep. We rent a lot of apartments in our travels and only mention it in this review as the poor quality of the bedding is not inline with the high quality of the apartment - I would suggest to management to add a mattress topper to provide a more comfortable sleep and provide better pillows. The apartment itself is very quiet, though, and spacious and we definitely appreciated the washer AND dryer, so rare in european apartments but much appreciated. The kitchen is a good size and has everything you need, including a dishwasher.And, the last thing to be mindful of is the stairs to ‘Lovely’ apartment. 5 flights. Makes baggage transfer a bit tricky. Book something lower down. That’s the trade off with being in a lovely building that is many years old and no lift. The staff were very helpful and the 24hr concierge is a great asset in an apartment building. ","January 8, 2018","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

1320,"We stayed at the Sun-Lit Apartment Loft in Old town. Our first impression was not good as we walked in the apartment and it smelled of smoke and the a/c was not on. 3 of us tried and tried to turn both units on with no luck. IT was HOT. I called the manager (well fellow at front desk called for me- who was amazing btw) and she proceeded to tell me we did not book ac and to show her the email. So i hunted for the email, found it and sent it to her.. When we returned from dinner they tried to tell us the air is working and we just were all too stupid to turn it on,lol... not likely. It was definitely set off. So once the air was on, i could settle down. The apartment was clean, although smelled. It was extremely spacious in a very great area. You walk outside your front door and are in the busy busting streets of Old Town. The bed upstairs was terrific but the pullout downstairs was not so good. I recommend this apartment to a couple ( only if the AC is on) and not more than 2 or kids could sleep on the pullout. This was the second year I have stayed with Prague Apartments. Their communication is very good and I find their pricing reasonable. I would book with them again but perhaps a higher end apartment with modern air conditioning especially in summer.","July 30, 2017","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

While arriving, i got the parking within a couple of minutes as someone was leaving. As i parked and came out of the car, i saw a couple of cars waiting already.

1325,"There are many positives for these apartments. The location is just off the city Center! They were spacious clean and warm! I booked the apartment and payed the higher rate for the luxury apartment after looking at the gallery online I expected the more attractive looking apartment however the apartment we got was fairly bog standard. I asked our booking agent for a bunch of roses and bottle of prosecco/champagne to be put in the apartment as we would be arriving on our anniversary. Although I was told this would be no problem it never materialised which left me a little disappointed. The wifi in our apartment didn't work, I tried to reset the box but with no success and when I spoke to our agent he said this would be fixed but again it never happened, we managed to connect to another rooms wifi but the signal strength was poor.When we first used the shower (bath with wall mounted shower head) I opened the glass door/shower curtain. The door fell off of its hinges and landed on the floor bruising my ankle on the way down!!! How it did not smash I do not know! I tried to explain this to the lady on reception however she didn't speak a word of English and couldn't understand it either!! So I tried to explain these problems to our booking agent as they were very good at communicating before our arrival and we sent emails back and forth regarding airport transfers etc. However once we had arrived they didn't reply once to my emails expect when they wanted the €25 for our airport transfer which we were told we'd have to pay the driver but the driver said to pay at reception.Our bed was a large double and very comfortable however the pillows were the size of small cushions which was frustrating during the night and the duvet's were two separate singles so me and my partner just as well had slept in separate beds!!When I made the booking with booking.com I was asked to secure the booking with a credit card which is the norm, however the week before we arrived I was charged full price onto my credit card when I wanted to use my debit card on arrival as I always do when using booking.com so this was another inconvenience!A brilliant location they just let themselves down with the service and the few minor issues in the room.

1329,"U Kapra Apartments are well located in Male Namesti – a small square next to the main square in the old town. We had the so-called Elegant Apartment which was a well-appointed and very spacious one bedroom apartment with large sofas in the lounge area that could have been converted into more bedding. It was on the third floor accessed by a lift from a lobby that always had a security person there. Despite the heavy traffic flow of people in this tourist central area, the apartment was extremely quiet with very effective double glazing. On occasions you could hear a few late night exits from some of the bars in the square but it was not problematic. The key plus was that it was in easy walking distance of every attraction as well as restaurants and the all-important tram no 22. It also was reasonably close to the large Tesco supermarket. The kitchen was well equipped with a dishwasher and a washer /dryer. The only two minor issues were that the curtains were not totally light proof (fine in October but perhaps not in July) and the sofas were a bit difficult to sit on comfortably.

1341,"Having just finished my short break in Prague with my partner I must say we were really happy with the overall experience of the apartment.As I stated in the title, I think we'd struggle to find a place more central to the sites we came to see. What you get for the price tag is reasonable, although there are various small improvements that could make the difference between the 4 bubbles I gave and the 5 I would have awarded them.My first point would be that of the 'serviced' element of their description. As in all the other places I've stayed, I would have hoped for daily housekeeping, if only to change the towels.There are basic levels of initial goods I expect from this type of accommodation; coffee, milk, shampoo... The kind of stuff you need once you've completed your journey there and for the next morning.The living room was clean and comfortable and the entertainment equipment was adequate, if you like Czech television. There is a DVD player, so pack one or two if you want to spend an evening in.The shower is positioned incredibly low and a certain amount of contortion was required to wash myself from the shoulders up. The bath was also quite high, so my not so tall girlfriend struggled to get out, which was quite comical.The bed was comfortable but the pillows left a lot to be desired and seemed to have been omitted from the production line prior to the last stage - putting the stuffing in them.Whilst the rooms were nothing to be sniffed at and have everything depicted in the photos, be aware that the photographer who took the shots is a magician and the lighting and ambience is considerably different in real life.The rooms had great sound proofing from the street outside, although the inner walls were thin and you could hear others in the building. There's a few jobs on the list which the maintenance man has missed, there was a cracked tile on the bath and the bedroom door handle fell off on it's first use.Would return.","November 12, 2015","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

1342,"After arriving in Prague, we headed straight for the apartment to freshen up and decide what to do for the rest of the afternoon. Google maps took us to karlova street, being where the apartment is. However it took us a couple of trips around the block, 3 phone calls and a visit to the local tourist board to actually find the apartment. Finally we navigated our way back to where google maps had previously taken us, and on the side of a door was a small sign saying 'u kapra apartments'. We were expecting some kind of font on the front of the building, whereas we were greeted by a small sticker proclaiming to be the place we were looking for, which we easily over looked as we aimlessly and repeatedly walked past the door. The woman at the reception was helpful and gave us our keys. The apartment itself was clean and modern with good cooking and entertainment equipment. There was even a filter coffee machine which turned out to be a little pointless, when there is no coffee. There was no tea, milk, sugar or anything to drink either. I've stayed in many serviced apartments before and I expect a 'serviced' apartment to have the basics for making a drink. There was also no shower gel or shampoo for the shower, meaning we had to go out and buy some before being able to freshen up after travelling. The apartment was spacious and practical, and we weren't planning on spending too much time there anyway. The bed itself was comfy and I liked the two separate duvets, meaning there was no arguments between me and my partner. The pillows on the other hand were small and square and had no stuffing. I had to fold another duvet to use as a pillow. My partner who usually sleeps with one, had 3 under his head every night. The bath and shower combination was not very practical. I'm not particularly tall so to try and get out of the shower over the side of the bath proved difficult every time bearing in mind the water makes everything slippy. I will reiterate that I'm not particularly tall, so to have to crouch under the shower head to wash my hair because it is placed too low is unusual. God knows what my 6'1"" partner had to do.However, the apartment was in a perfect location, just around the corner from the old square and the astronomical clock and a short walk from Charles bridge. All in all, perfectly acceptable for the money you pay. ","November 12, 2015","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

1343,"We rented to Sunlit apartment, and after struggling a bit to find the door (very small signage), we were pleasantly surprised by the apartment. Two floors, with an upstairs balcony looking over the rooftops of Prague. Since the apartment is an inner courtyard, the noise of Old Town is completely blocked. Full kitchen, living room, sound system, washer, and two bathrooms make this a great place to unwind after some long travel days. The location cannot be beat, just steps away from the main square and clock. The elevator is a nice touch, but be ready at night to find a light switch, as the hallways are kept dark (energy savings?). Would definitely use again on our next (hopefully soon) return to Prague.","October 7, 2015","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

1344,"This place is simply perfect. We stayed in a huge two bedroom U Kapra apartment. This is literally the best location in the entire city of Prague for one to stay. The Old Market area is full of restaurants, shops and historical destinations. The apartments are well equipped with lots of space to live. Most importantly, especially in the summer time, the apartment has a great air conditioning. The only negative is that there is no where close to park a personal vehicle. This is easily rectified because there is a public parking lot a few blocks away. But be warned it will be a bit of a hike with your bags. We will stay here again when we visit Prague.

It had air conditioning, a clothes washer/dryer, a fully equipped kitchen, an elevator and good wifi. Although the apartment was spacious it could have been more comfortable for the money we were spending. The sofa felt a little damp and when you sat on it the bottom would pull out because it was a sleeper sofa. The dining room chairs where metal and were very uncomfortable. Although the place was generally clean the refrigerator was dirty and the freezer looked like it hadn't been clean in a long time. I had to find some baking powder to put in the fridge to take away the smell. The clothes washer was also a dryer but it didn't dry anything. We air dried our clothes.

A grocery store was a five minute walk down the street to pick up breakfast supplies. You have a key for the front door and one for the apartment. A security person mans a front desk inside 24 hours a day.

1350,"Firstly I want to make one thing clear, the apartment itself is very nice. Perfect location in the centre of old town and as close to everything as you could possibly want. The apartment had all the modern conveniences of a serviced apartment and was very clean on arrival and very spacious. This is where the positives end:Upon arrival we were given keys to a room on level 4. The elevator only goes to level 3 so 4 of us had to carry 4 large suitcases up a tiny narrow staircase to actually reach level 4. My father 65yr old has recently recovered from a double hip replacement so this was a huge issue for him and proved to be a huge issue for 7 days. When we reached room it was completely different room to the pictures and to the style i had booked 1 yr earlier. We were given a dark attic apt with almost no natural light nor any view except other rooftops through porthole sized windows. The reason i booked the EXECUTIVE 2 BEDROOM APARTMENT was because it had large windows that opened out to the main square and so there were no stairs for my father. Also within the apt the 2nd bed was up another flight of internal stairs and was completely open to the rest of the apt offering no privacy at all and was impossible to carry large cases up to the 2nd loft bed due to the tiny stairs. So for 7 days our caes sat in the kitchen area constantly in the way of everyone.I immediately went back down to reception to ask to speak to the agent who was in charge of my booking. The reception lady made a call and the woman I spoke tried to make out that this was the right apt I had booked and that there was nothing she could do. After some time and getting nowhere she said she would speak to the guy in charge of my booking and call back within 30mins. 50mins later no one called so I called back and eventually was able to speak to the correct agent. He offered some apologies and said he would try and move us to a 3 bed apt the following day. He said he would call me back that night or in morning to advise further. 2 days later I still had not received any call from anyone so I wrote 2 not so nice emails to the agent and someone else from his office to complain about the situation. A further day or so later he replied with an apology email about the situation and offered to meet with me at the apt the next day to apologize in person. I responded and said ok this is fine and gave him 2 days in which it would be possible to meet with me. This was the last contact i have had with him and still have not met with him nor heard further from anyone involved with the company. To date the only thing they gave me was a comp airport tranfer which I had to ask for. I work in the hotel industry as a manager of a hotel that is part of a luxury chain so to experience such poor customer service really gave me a bad impression of Prague. I will go as far as saying our week was ruined due to the lack of urgency and compassion showed when there when there was a clear mistake made by the real estate that they acknowledged had been made. If they had deal with this on the day or the day after then my review would be much more positive. In a nut shell if you want the freedom of an apt in a great location the go right ahead. If you want to risk your holiday being ruined by incompetent agents taking care of your bookings then also go ahead.","March 18, 2015","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

1353,"We have just stayed in U Kapra unlit apartment for one week. Well located and equipped exactly what you see on net is product . Recommendation for owners that the reception staff speak English. We arrived and you are transferred by phone to speak to your agent which is all ok( as receptionist doesn't speak English). We were asked to review and sign contract by 11 am the next morning.we had used their advertised shuttle service to arrive and we were asked to enclose 20 euro for the taxi. I also arranged our pickup for our departure . We agreed to enclose the money and contact in sealed envelope . The next morning reception was not at the desk and we had a tour organised. We left the envelope on the desk but away from full view. It had our name on the front. When we returned reception was very anxious fir us to speak to our agent which I did by phone. She asked for the fee for the shuttle indicating she had contract but not money!! As I indicated to her we would have handed over envelope the same if desk manned or not. To the management credit she said it was their fault and was ok. I then confirmed our departure arrangements verbally and by email. We were picked up by taxi driver at designated spot after U Kapra was indicated by driver on the day of departure. However when we got to train station he wanted to be paid. We indicated that we had paid 20 Euro already. He took apartment details and we left for our train. Not sure whether driver was trying to get extra money or incorrect driver however the process could be improved. We would have been happy to pay in our accomodation, safer. Not sure where the 40 Euro went however worked out for us. Otherwise highly recommend.","January 12, 2015","24    Prague Apartments U Kapra

Both rooms were also ready well before the given time of 2pm, which was brilliant. Staff all very friendly, although most staff only speak very basic English.

Zorica was our agent and she was very quick to respond and was quite helpful, especially when we had some confusion about an airport transfer. The Vault apartment was absolutely stunning! Two great bedrooms, two large bathrooms, and a fantastic living space! The apartments are in a perfect location in the middle of Old Town, close to the Astronomical clock, the Charles Bridge, and great restaurants and shopping. But even better was the fact that as soon as you came into the complex through the external door, all the noise and crowds melted away. The apartment was a perfect oasis of quiet and serenty in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Old Town Prague. The 24 hour attendant was helpful and provided an extra sense of security. The only minor complaint we had was the smaller bedroom had an excellent air conditioner, but the master bedroom only had a fan. The listing clearly says it is only partially air conditioned, so there was no mis-representation, but a second air conditioner would have been great. Otherwise it was a fantastic experience! Thomas was our driver to the airport when we left and he was personable and professional, even going the extra mile of helping us carry our baggage into the airport.

Two small negatives: the double bed is in fact two single mattresses. The staff should put on the $50 connector that covers the crack between the two beds.

To make a long story short I ordered room service on three separate occasions, each time having to call multiple times to get someone to answers the phone and it progressively got worse until our final attempt our food never showed up and we were without breakfast for a tour we had that morning. This is such a frustrating issue because the food was great when it did show up but the total disregard for service ruined my experience with what could be such a fine hotel.Just to top it off I called and went down to the front desk asking to speak to a manager about my issues with no response.","May 8, 2019","25    Best Western Plus Hotel Meteor Plaza

I was concerned about the hot water issue and the size of the room after reading the reviews. Well, my concerns were for naught! This was an absolutely lovely hotel, and I would stay again. It was only a few blocks away from Canal Street and the French Quarter,so we had pleasant walks every day. The housekeeping staff was very good; they did miss my request for another container of shampoo one day, but made up for that the next day. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and pleasant. The PB&J tradition in the lobby was charming and very good. Breakfast at the hotel was just okay, but we were jaded after all of the excellent meals we’d already had. The outside of the hotel is very appealing, surrounded by boring office towers. The lobby is beautiful and elegant. We didn’t think the room was too small at all, or the bathroom. Certainly I’ve stayed in hotels with larger rooms, but we were perfectly satisfied.

The maid was lovely.Kettle, tea bags and coffee in the room also a mini bar.The hotel doesn’t have a restaurant or a bar which is strange. Actually, that’s not quite correct........ there is a bar in a restaurant but the room is only open for breakfast. There is a room service menu but the food is delivered from a restaurant across the road.Breakfast is nice; bacon, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, sausages, potatoes, porridge, fruits, cheeses, meat, various bread rolls and sliced bread ( to toast), hams and fruit. Fruit juices etcStaff on reception very nice and helpful as were all the staff at breakfast .Fantastic bakery/cafe, 2 nice restaurants ( Matilda’s was excellent both for the quality of the food and the friendly service) Macdonalds, KFC, salad bar, a mini supermarket and a Costa all within a stones throw of the hotel and plenty more restaurants/bars within the immediate surrounding area.You can walk to all the main sights easily from here or catch one of the trams from the corner of the road.Hotel facilities really warrant a 3 rating but because of the cleanliness, quality of breakfast and the lovely staff I gave it a 4.","June 4, 2019","26    Clarion Hotel Prague City

Even an iron and ironing board, should you feel inclined to use them. Good sized bathroom with toiletries included. Breakfast was included and consistent of cereals, bread, pastries, cheeses, meats, fruits and a choice of got food. Tea, coffee and juices available too. Although no bar or evening restaurant, it was only a 10 minute walk to St Wenceslas Square where there is plenty of choice of restaurants.

Altho a bit of traffic outside, inside the rooms were quiet. Hotel in the middle of the block where there are restaurants, small shops and an ice cream shop next door. Across the street another hotel where guests were being dropped off/picked up by tour buses. I much rather prefer the Clarion Hotel, less noise, less traffic through their small lobby. Desk clerks were busy but friendly, accommodating and helpful . Breakfast in the morning had plenty to offer and tasty. 2 of us sharing the room and we were quite comfortable, cozy is the word. Rooms/bathroom, carpet, tiles, walls was clean, spotless and fresh smelling; no distinct odors at all. We were only here one night and used cabs to get around. Two tips, be sure to take a hotel business card showing location of hotel, every cab driver we used were not familiar and 2) make sure you know which Clarion you are staying; there are 3 in Prague.","December 28, 2018","26    Clarion Hotel Prague City

1439,"There seems to be nothing to regret about choosing this place to stay in Prague. There is a tram stop just down the street (I. Pavlova); take the no. 22 that will bring you to the Infant Jesus of Prague and the Old Town. A DM grocery just to the right outside the lobby. Kentucky fried chicken and McDonald’s just a few steps away. Wenceslas square for shopping and dining a nice 10-minute walk. At the end of the square when you turn right at the corner you will see an Adidas store within a mall; this has the best currency exchange rate among all that I transacted with. About a block away you will also see the Nike store; here you can have tax refund instead of at the airport; remember though that you need at least a 2,500 Ckc purchase before you can vail of it. The refund will also be Ckc. Back to Clarion hotel, check-in is a breeze, wi-fi is complimentary, and the room comfortable with wall-to-wall carpet, an oversized tub, mini bar, safe, ironing board, eletric kettle and a double twin bed converted to one. TV has 3 English channels (Russia Today, BBC, and an info guide). At least during our stay, they were showing the football world cup games live. There is even a Handy mobile device for roaming calls and map directions should you need one. A desktop computer in the lobby also is helpful. Breakfast fare is basic but the sausages really stand out. The staff are also really helpful, especially with directions; I suggest before you go out, get as much information as you can as it is extremely difficult communicating with the locals in the street as most will shy away with the slightest hint of English. The 200+ euro per night price tag might be a bit steep but with all the pluses, it’s difficult to complain.","June 15, 2018","26    Clarion Hotel Prague City

The tram and the Metro is right around the corner which is really convenient to get into the city centre. And the breakfast was nice. They had a very good restaurant setting and plenty of selection. The service was professional and friendly. The reception was helpful anytime we had questions. It really helps when everyone is speaking English. The reason for one star less is the bedding. They didn't have one double bed so they had push two single beds next to each other. So it still felt like sleeping in two separate beds. My husband is 6'2"" and the comforter on each bed was really small. We did ask for a larger one but they told us that it was not available. The bed was soft but the pillows were the worst. They were so soft. Again this is a preference when we do prefer little firmer bed and pillow. The rooms were clean. It had all the amenities needed and included a safe as well. One weird thing was the soap. Although we would open it up and use it in the shower and in the sink they would not replace the daily. Maybe it was just an oversight.

It is right in the heart of Prague with everything all around you at walking distance. The staff that work in here are brilliant, very polite and very professional at their jobs. They will help you with booking taxis if you need them, they will also help you by booking your trips that you wish to go on, giving you that peace of mind about weather or not it’s booked. The food is lovely, well layed out. The service from the staff regarding food is brilliant, they always make you feel welcome and always there topping food and drink up.

The breakfast had plenty of choice and the cakes and pastries were especially good.

Safety box, iron and ironing board, kettle, plenty of storage and coat hangers, fully stocked mini bar that was cheaper than I expected, there was a hair dryer in the bathroom too. Two big windows give a view of a bustling city, just visible are the tops of the twin spires of St. Ludmila Church which is a pretty good landmark to use when getting your bearings as you can see it from the river! The breakfast isn't bad, standard stuff really, but lots of choice, hot food, cold meat and cheeses, fruit and vegetables, different breads, croissants, pain aux chocolat etc... lots of choice of juice, flavoured water, tea and coffee etc... The hotel is situated in a busy but not so touristy part of Prague, there are several restaurants, bars and shops in the area. Lots of variety for food and drink, if your a fast food fan your sorted, if you like fine dining that box is also ticked, but there's pretty much everything you'd want right on your doorstep. If your in doubt ask at reception, they'll tell you all you need to know! There is a metro station 2 minutes walk from the hotel which will whisk you off to all corners of prague, buy a 3 day ticket and you can use it on all the public transport so you won't have to worry about sight seeing.

1466,"A clean and modern hotel, staff pleasant and helpful, room for 2 was small but a great use of space with lots of clothes hanging space, beds comfortable and a very good air conditioning system in the room. Breakfast was very good although only a small selection of fruit. The main disadvantage of the hotel is that it's reception area is very small, cramped in fact. It also has a bar but this was closed for the 4 nights we were there so to get a drink we had to find a bar elsewhere. I think the bar only opens for business when the hotel has a function. The hotel location is a bit out from the city centre, although the underground is only a short walk from the hotel. A plus is that the hotel has good free wifi. Would I stay there again ? No, it is too far out from the centre of Prague. ","May 22, 2017","26    Clarion Hotel Prague City

1470,After a long journey we finally arrived at the Clarion where we wanted to check in. Unfortunately the Clarion Prague City accepts only guests with Passports even we had a international approved Military ID which is fully legal to travel within Europe. After the comment that maybe the police comes and we might get in trouble we decided not to check in this Hotel. The NH did welcome us without problems and a free drink for a better price.

1471,We stayed here for some nights to discover Prag. The hotel is close by the Wencleass Place so the old city area is in walking distance. The fotos I saw make me believe that it is a stylish hotel. I could see that those room exists we do had one of other ones.It was not stylish but clean and big enough. But since it had small windows and dark brown furnitures it looked more than a cave. I believe that the hotel was just in the upper floors of this building so instead having a fitness room they had stairs. But to be fair there was also an elevator. So the location is execellent for tourists. It is in walking distance to the main station and to the must-see places in this nice town.,"July 12, 2019","27    Wenceslas Square Hotel

1475,"My initial impression of this hotel was quite good. When we arrived it was mid morning but check in wasn't until 2pm which wasn't a big deal. We didn't really have a problem waiting till then and decided to go for a wander around the area. The reception staff apologised and said they would try to get our room ready as soon as possible but as they said it was 2pm before we got in. There was two of us and we were given a room that slept 8 people. There was no air conditioning in the room but there was a fan which didn't really help too much in the heat of mid June when the temperature was up at 34°c. There was a fridge in the room for the mini bar but as always you have to pay for what you use. My friend and I emptied the bar so we could put our own juice and water in as we preferred fruit juice and still water as opposed to Sparling and fizzy. As our flight to go home was really early and we knew we wouldn't be up for the trek on the metro, tram and bus back to the airport we opted to pay for a taxi which we booked with the hotel for the price of 670 krowns. Now I know for a fact that the staff member I spoke to write down the correct time I asked her to book it for as I said it atleast four times and I watched her write it down but on the day we left the taxi arrived half and hour early and the staff member that day insisted that it was booked for 6.15 instead of 6.45 and because we weren't ready the taxi had to wait for us and we were then charged another 130 krowns for the wait. We queried this and we're told it was cause the taxi had to wait. It was obvious the hotel and taxi company were in cahoots and like i said the hotel shafted us. So if you stay in this hotel I wouldn't recommend booking taxis with the hotel unless you wait until you check out and ask them to phone for one then. Now I know it wasn't alot of money to pay extra but what if we hadn't had any money left to pay the wait fee? I am not happy with this and I hope others will see this review and take note.","June 13, 2019","27    Wenceslas Square Hotel

1477,"We were in Prague for 3 days, from our visit to Bavaria. Prague is beautiful. When we checked in the Manger shared that the only elevator was out of commission due to 12 people attempting to ride the night prior. Our room was on the 5th floor & nothing available closer to 1! 5 flights of stairs with suitcase & tote bag & none of us are ""spring chickens"" was too much. There was no offer of assistance with luggage due to elevator being out. ALso, we asked about the hop on hop off tour & manager again said oh I have a much better tour - it's the best in the city. IT's 6 hours & I reiterated that I didn't want to walk for 6 hours & he said oh no - the car actually picks you up at the hotel & takes you to the bus. That part was true & then we walked for 6 hours - well 5 since we stopped at hour 4.5 for 45 min lunch & we bailed not up for walking another hour immediately following heavy meal.

The rooms are cheap ish but none of us will unfortunately return as we would rather go somewhere else and pay more. I wouldn’t go in the front downstairs room number 8 friend ms did for one night and got no sleep due to the road, noisy people and the door being heavy and slamming. We were opposite in room 9 which really it was the door and staff being inconsiderate in the morning which was annoying for us, one time being 630am in a Sunday morning. The issues with these 2 rooms is its where the downstairs toilet is along with either a staff room or cleaning room, not great. Somebody called Daniel was very kind and moved my friends in room 8 in the end but with little help from other staff we had tried to talk to and then call/email while we were out during the day.

1501,"Simple, unassuming atmosphere. Clean bathroom, firm beds, and spacious bedroom. Very central, right by Muzeum metro station and Wenceslas Square, which means most of the city centre can be traversed by walking from the hotel.The good:-Clean-Simple (no unnecessary amenities)-Central-Comfortable beds-Cheap-Breakfast not included (so you may choose)-Proper hot water in the shower-AC outlet in the bathroom and a generous amount in the roomThe bad:-Certain rooms only have ceiling windows (mine did, could not see out of it)-Thin white curtain to block daylight. Not very effective.-Traffic noise from nearby street (sirens especially)-Thin walls – other guests coming & going and talking can be heard-No bath, very simple shower without shower hose-Fluorescent lighting only – effective illumination but not cosy-HOT. Floor heating is nice, but room temperatures were close to 30°C (86°F) when I checked in and it took a long time before it dropped to the mid-20's after I turned all the way down.

After going from hotel to hotel, someone recommended this one and it’s a good thing that they did. They had rooms at a great rate along with different options for parking. The garage was full but they had a virtual parking option that allowed us to leave our car on the street overnight within the blue lines for a small fee. We also purchased the breakfast option which allowed us to get a quicker start to the day because we did not have to go searching for breakfast. The room was a good size and the beds were very comfortable. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly.

The beds were comfortable, but the pillows were pretty flat (we made it work and didn't want to make it an issue). The towels were sometimes changed out but not always. At least one day, 2 of our 4 towels were taken away but not replaced with new ones. The 2 that were left were still damp.

1522,"I stayed in this hotel for three weeks as part of a business trip for work. I can't speak highly enough of every member of staff who I encountered - especially the lady on breakfast duty who came to recognise me every morning. It's a nice friendly touch especially because some members of staff on breakfast duty didn't seem to be morning people.The breakfast buffet itself is superb and well worth the (very affordable) price. There's everything you could possibly want for breakfast, although at times the toaster wasn't working. There were even homemade cakes available, a couple of which were so divine I went back for more. It definitely helps to set you up for the day with a wide range of vegetarian options instead of the meatier ones available. There were salads, cooked and cold meats, eggs, breads and toast with a whole load of toppings, pancakes on weekends, fresh fruit, a massive range of hot drinks, as well as homemade cold drinks like the ginger lemonade or just ice water. The location of this hotel just can't be beaten as Wenceslas Square and the Metro are within two minutes walk away! Once the new museum nearby has finished renovations (could be soon I think) it will be even better for tourists I think. If you don't know your way around Prague the front-desk reception provide a map and talk you through some of the must-see attractions, which was a really nice gesture. Prague is very easy to navigate and everywhere is accessible by foot, with some gorgeous architecture to admire as you make your way to your chosen destination.The slight hang-up of my stay was that I was on the very top floor. There is a lift that takes you to floor five but there were two flights of steps to go up - luckily I'm not too unfit but after three weeks of going up and down those stairs I was definitely made fitter haha It wasn't a big issue for me and it's admirable the hotel owners made the most of the space :) The views over the city especially during the morning and evening were really quite something - as you come out of the lift and look through the window on the right I was always taken aback by the beauty, so being so high up had its benefits.I was recommended to visit the rooftop bar but never quite managed to go, sadly! Next time I come to Prague I would consider this hotel and will make sure to go up there. If you're considering this hotel definitely book it.Thank you to the staff who made my stay so welcomed.","October 21, 2018","27    Wenceslas Square Hotel

The rooms aren't enormous but nor are they tiny so they were great for a base of operations complete with TV, air conditioner and writing desk, which was a Skoda sewing machine!!! but no kettle in the room. The breakfast was good with porridge, eggs, cold meats, cheese and breads and lots of cakes??? Tea is available in the breakfast room to wash your cakes down and any other breakfast you may choose. The hotel had lots of interesting articles dotted about, typewriters, artwork etc. The restaurant was lovely with a great range of local and international foods and at a great price with great local beer to wash it all down.All in it was a great hotel which I will use again when I next visit and I will look for others in the group","October 18, 2018","27    Wenceslas Square Hotel

Breakfast was excellent and the wonderful staff working in the breakfast room kept the place immaculate. The food was good, with options for a hot meal, cereal or delicious fresh breads and pastries. There were several fresh juice options and a variety of teas and coffee. The reception staff were all extremely friendly and helpful advising us on local transport routes. Our only niggle was the restaurant area- we arrived in the evening and the restaurant seemed very short staffed with the man on duty seeming quite stressed about managing the bar and the restaurant. (He also has to deal with lots of requests for ice as the machine was broken) We did manage to have a meal there but felt it was difficult for him to arrange and that he really wanted to close up. ( it was 9.45pm and we were lead to believe the restaurant was open until 11pm ) The food was good - unfortunately the atmosphere was not.

There is a lounge area and a library in the downstairs lobby which is a bit British in style....very nice to sit and enjoy a nightcap in the evening which we did most nights. The hotel also has an onsite restaurant in the lower level which is very small and very unique in that it is three levels, with circular wrought iron staircases which connect the levels. The food here is very good and the service, as in the entire hotel is excellent. Our room was very large with a queen and a single bed and plenty of room for the extra chair and coffee table. The bathroom was great as was the cleanliness. We just loved the staff here. Very welcoming and helpful and offered us a free proseco or beer upon our arrival along with some information and a map which was very helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

We were initially a little worried that it was outside Old Town, but public transportation was very simple and amazingly reliable, and it was also a very nice 15-20 minute walk into old town as well if we felt like it. We were given a very cool top floor room, which felt very spacious with clean decor. I loved how the windows opened out and the shades that completely blacked out the room (helped with jet lag). The breakfast every morning was delicious with both hot and cold offerings, a delightful array of pastries, and a wonderful coffee/latte machine. Hotel Julian, with its elegant public rooms decor, felt calm and peaceful. We didn't eat at the on site restaurant downstairs, but we did pick up a couple of pilsners (what else would we get, right?) and a dessert to take up to the outdoor terrace. There was a lovely view of the castle as well as the spires in old town. Last, and most important, all the staff were warm and attentive. Special call out to Jan, Radka, Ivana, and Marcela.

We also visited the mall that is close by for essentials. The only reason that I would deduct a star is for the spotty wifi. I could not connect to the wifi reliably and while it wasn't a deal breaker for my husband and I, had I brought my young adult son, the wifi issue would have been stressful.

1538,We spent 4 nights at Hotel Julian last week 19-22 May and enjoyed our stay. Our room was nice with everything you need however we felt the hotel itself was a little too quiet for our liking. The restaurant/bar is in the basement which I think is wasted and there was never anyone in when I looked in!! There's a library/sitting area beside reception which is nice but again all very quiet. Breakfast was ok although not a lot of choice in cereals and gets a bit repetitive after a couple of days. The city's main attractions are about a 20 minute walk away which is fine if it's not raining but we suffered two days of rain and got a little damp walking back to the hotel on these days!! There's a really nice roof terrace which would be ideal on a warm sunny day but unfortunately for us we only got spells of sunshine whilst there.All in all I would definitely return to Prague but would probably stay closer to the city's main attractions in a livelier hotel. I would like to mention Marcela on reception who was a lovely friendly woman who offered us some great pointers on the city.,"May 27, 2019","28    Hotel Julian

The hotel is located in Prague 5 and is a 10 minute walk to Prague Castle The receptionists at the desk were very helpful with all of our questions. When we checked in we were both offered a complimentary beer and given a map of old town Prague. The receptionist went over the map with us and highlighted key areas to visit and areas to stray from and also gave us some tips on how to “act like a local”. When we checked into our room we were amazed with how sparkling clean it was. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was fairly big with a huge tub. There was also a mini bar with beer, wine, water and snacks. The hotel has an access to a roof top terrace with beautiful views of Prague. A great place to relax and have a few drinks. We also booked a massage with the hotel masseuse. The masseuse was extremely professional. I would recommend this hotel to any couple visiting Prague. ","May 13, 2019","28    Hotel Julian

We dined in the cosy hotel restaurant which restored some of my faith in Czech cuisine after having had an awful meal at a neighbouring restaurant the previous evening.

Staff even knows which tram or bus to take to where you want to go. They arrange anything you need such as an airport pickup, concert tickets, massage, or any other Prague type activity. The entire hotel is beautiful like a mini museum. Our room was just right, comfortable beds, plenty of space, sound proof windows, hot water that never runs out in the shower, high ceilings. Location is good we walked to most attractions and took the tram a few times. To top it off the breakfast is practically gourmet with their own latte, expresso machine. Just behind the hotel is a beautiful park that we spent a full day hiking the well maintained trails. We liked this hotel so much we rebooked for our return to Prague to catch our flight home after touring other countries.","April 19, 2019","28    Hotel Julian

The plus point were peeled and sliced fresh oranges, pineapples and grapefruits replacing the usual and standard macedoine of fruits. Also, proposing slices of ginseng with thee was a nice surprise. Another plus point are the lockers for those having to check out and stilling willing to visit Prague before departure. Furthermore, they benefit of a very practical bathroom with shower, toilet and even all what is needed for ironing ! Location is excellent ! 200m from public transport, 10 minutes from the Kampa island and the same walking distance to the huge shopping mall U Andela (also metro station).

1557,"As part of an extended European trip, my wife and I were scheduled to spend three days in Prague in the first week of March 2019, for which we chose Hotel Julian. The hotel is located about 20 mins from the airport (by taxi). Located very near to the heart of the city, it is a quaint hotel in semi-busy neighbourhood, with several restaurants and pubs at a walking distance. Upon entering the hotel premises, we received a warm welcome by John Novacek, the client relations manager (his exact job title might be slightly different), who made us feel comfortable from the very first minute of entering. John was very helpful and informative and helped us finalise our itinerary and suggested some of the best restaurants / pubs we could visit (add U Modre Kachnicky to your list right now!). The interior of the hotel is a perfect hybrid of vintage décor and latest technology. The highlight of our stay was the staff members (primarily John and one of their reception attendants Marcela) who were very helpful, polite and friendly. Their breakfast buffet was excellent and was managed seamlessly by a lady who always had a smile on her face. Every facility we used was flawless and our stay at Julian was the highlight of our entire trip. The room prices were very competitive, and worth every cent we spent there.

1570,"There are a number of positives about this hotel. The first is the staff. Everyone we encountered during our stay was helpful, warm and friendly. They clearly wanted to ensure that the guests had a great time. The second is cleanliness. Everything was clean. The third is the hotel's location. It is a very pleasant 20 minute walk to Prague Castle and a 25 minute walk to the Old Town. It is close to some great restaurants and is in a quiet part of town.However, I am surprised that this hotel has received such a large number of positive reviews. The standard of the room we stayed in was very poor. The beds were extremely small and, much worse, had mattresses which are very uncomfortable and clearly extremely old. The decor of the rooms is dated and the air conditioning unit did not work. The lighting was depressing. There was also an unpleasant smell that did not dissipate throughout our 4 night stay. Although the bathroom was clean, the shower was basic (to say the least). The TV was small and had a very limited selection of channels (and no Smart functionality or anything similar). Although following previous reviews the management has stated that the wifi has been upgraded, it was unusably slow throughout our stay.I have noticed that in response to previous reviews the management has complained that guests have not given them a chance to rectify issues. However, this hotel advertises itself as a 4* hotel and the quality of the room we stayed in was 2* at best. It is not the responsibility of the guest to ensure that the room they receive is adequate and as advertised. In our case, the hotel was fully booked during our stay and so even if there were an opportunity for us to switch to a room which was adequate then it would have meant placing guests in our inadequate room.

The beds were not the most comfortable and i doubt if i could have stayed in them for longer than 3 nights. The radiators were controllable so you could set them up to be warm when you came in after a night out. We went to eat in the restaurant one night but we found it to be a bit cold and lacking in atmosphere. We had one drink in the restaurant but took drinks to the lounge for the rest of the time.

There is also a wide range of eating and drinking options here if you are looking for a change of scenery from the hustle and bustle of the Old Town as well as a large supermarket.It may be a year or two until we go back to Prague but when we do we will be looking to stay at the Hotel Julian again.","November 28, 2018","28    Hotel Julian

1578,"Prior to landing we phoned the hotel to arrange a transfer from the airport to the hotel, we were greeted with a glass of Prosecco upon arrival and shown tourist spots etc. The room was on the first floor and was very spacious, the bath was big enough for two! Maids came everyday and room was looking spotless. Breakfast was perfect just what was needed, good selection of fruit, yoghurt, cereal, pastries, meats, fruit juices, tea, coffee, bread, and warm choices such as bacon, scrambled egg and veg. Hotel staff were very helpful when asked about surrounding areas, tourists sports, places to eat and shop etc and also booked our taxi back to the airport. Would have liked to try out the spa but unfortunately did not have time. Has a wander up to the roof terrace which would have been lovely to sit out on in summer unfortunately in November this was all frosted over however blankets are provided. Hotel is situated around a ten minute walk to the Charles bridge, the old town around 20 minutes but all flat and short distance on foot, many supermarkets 5 min walk away. All in all a lovely hotel enjoyed our stay would definitely recommend and if we ever return to Prague I would book this hotel again. ","November 19, 2018","28    Hotel Julian

1580,"We stayed here three nights and cannot say enough positive things about this small, family-run hotel. It was wonderful. Location is great. It's in the ""Little Quarter"" area, about a 10 minute walk from the Charles Bridge. The Prague Castle is also walkable (maybe 15 minutes); the staff will tell you a short cut from the hotel. The street is quiet - across from German embassy and near U.S. embassy - outside the Old Town madness but still close enough for visits. We had planned to use trams to get around but ended up walking only because the location was that good. (Admittedly, we are big walkers, and walked about 10 miles each day.)The hotel itself is in a 500 year old building which has been beautifully restored. Our room had en suite modern bathroom with nice shower. We also had air conditioning which was very welcome during the heat wave that hit Prague during our visit. The beds (two twin, pulled together, as is typical in many European hotels) was comfortable. We also had chairs to sit. It was a great room.Breakfast is included and it is a nice breakfast with yogurt, breads, ham & cheese, scrambled eggs, fruit, and juices, coffee & tea. I also want to give a shout out to the staff because they even provided us breakfast on our final day when we left the house at 4:00 a.m. for a 6:00 flight. They prepared ham & cheese sandwiches & juice for us, which they left in the common fridge; they offered coffee (which they would have left in a Thermos) and yogurt. I was really impressed that they went the ""extra mile"" (or would it be kilometer?) to make sure we were fed.Speaking of the common fridge, they have an honor fridge, from which you can take juice, soda, water, wine or beer. Then when you settle you bill, you tell them what you consumed from the honor fridge. It was so much more convenient than a vending machine or the likes and we were glad to remember what we consumed and pay the reasonable charge for it. Coffee and tea are always available without charge.The staff are very helpful, and the owners live on site. Among the helpful services the staff provided were arranging pick up at the train station (which I was glad we did - I think it might have been hard to find) as well as transfer to the airport at the end with a very nice car service. They also suggested restaurants, both Czech and international - and we happily tried - and enjoyed - their suggestions for all three of our dinners in Prague. Note that they are a cash only establishment - no credit cards. They told us this when we made our reservation so we were prepared and it worked out fine. They accept payment in Euros, dollars or, of course, Czech Koruna (and I think other currencies, too).Also, though I said we only walked & happily did so, it is fair to note that it is downhill to the Charles Bridge so naturally, it's uphill to the house. On the first night, I felt like we would never get there as we climbed back up the hill but after that I was fine. All in all, this was an absolutely wonderful stay and I would return there in a heartbeat. I highly recommend the House at the Big Boot!","July 6, 2019","29    House at the Big Boot

1581,"I came for a week of work in Prague. My husband came with me for sightseeing. We had been booked at a hotel that didn’t have air conditioning and since the forecast called for extreme heat, we scrambled and found the house at the big boot, which thankfully was air-conditioned. Because of our last-minute switch, we stayed in three different rooms. We loved all of them! Really cozy and well appointed, charming antique furniture, super duper clean and modern bathrooms. Jan and his staff truly make the place seem feel like a home away from home. When jan overheard that I needed to get up early for work, he volunteered to wake up and make me breakfast himself. His son Tom is a tour guide and took my husband on a two hour tour that was very enjoyable. The neighborhood literally can’t be beat. It’s right off of the main square of Male Strane, Really close to the Charles Bridge, castle and public transportation. yet it is the quietest, cutest street you could imagine.

It's close enough to the sites you want to see without having to stay in the middle of the mass of tourist. The location is quiet and the staff is incredible. The check in itself stood apart from any other property we stayed during our trip. We were offered coffee and provided with information about the city, where to go when to avoid the crowds, and other locations that may not be on your radar away from the crowds.

1584,"Funky historic hotel recommended by Rick Steves in a good location. The problems we encountered out weighted its charm. Our room was on the third floor with a “private” terrace (which other guests accessed). All rooms have foam mattresses, which we found to be too soft, very hot, and quite amortized. There was noise from other rooms, and creaking floors which is to be expected in an older building. We did not sleep well. The bathroom is small, with no sink stopper. The host requires cash payment in Euros or Czech Koruna, which is inconvenient. We heard one couple remark they felt like they were doing a drug deal. The breakfast was adequate, with average selection. Don’t expect fresh fruit of the season, home-made breads or a selection of deli meats and cheese – though ham and cheese was offered to us once during our stay. The staff on the other hand made every effort to make us feel welcome. They were friendly, and spoke English well. We went with their recommendation to use a private taxi to avoid rip-offs at the train station. We do not recommend this hotel.","June 11, 2019","29    House at the Big Boot

Our room was incredible! The furniture was beautiful. We stayed in the small apartment which was actually quite large. The doors were fascinating...So small in height. Everything was very clean. Jan gave us such a nice greeting each morning and cooked eggs any way you would like. The breakfast was yummy! The coffee was great! We were so busy touring that we did not take advantage of the tea that was always available. We also enjoyed the walk past the German and US embassy as we headed into town. It was a very safe area.

The room was fantastic with a comfortable deck that overlooked Prague homes to the north, west of the Vltava River, and a great view of Prague Castle. The entire staff was outstanding and very helpful regarding sightseeing and restaurant suggestions, and Laura was especially helpful with our check-in and ensuring our stay was the best it could be. We spoke with the owner, Jan, most evenings from our deck while taking in the beautiful view over a bottle of wine. The room accommodations were very comfortable, just be prepared to walk the 67 concrete spiral steps several times each day if you choose the attic suite. I'm sure rooms on the lower floors are just as nice, but for us, the attic suite was well worth the climb.","May 13, 2019","29    House at the Big Boot

As others have mentioned, this is a family owned and operated business -- Jan, Jakob, and Tomas (as well as other family members perhaps) -- are knowledgeable and gracious hosts. Both friendly and professional.My companion and I stayed in one of their ""cozy"" rooms, which I assumed would be tiny. It was not. It was large enough to have a small sitting area and the bathroom was quite large with a big shower. The whole house is architecturally interesting as well as well maintained and immaculately clean.Every morning Jan made eggs to order and they were delicious. The rest of the breakfast options included ham and cheese, yogurt, an assortment of breads/pastries, jams/butter, fresh fruit, juice, cereal, tea, and coffee. It was bountiful and fresh.The location is also quite wonderful. It is far enough away from the craziness of Old Town Square but within walking distance (about 10-15 minutes). The Castle, Petrin Park, the Charles Bridge, and Kampa Park is very close as are various pubs, restaurants, interesting shops, and minimarkets. The innkeepers will also arrange transportation for you to/from the airport, train station, or (I assume) other places as well at very reasonable prices. One last thing, the prices at the House at the Big Boot cannot be beat! I have paid as much as twice as much at other places for the same (or less!) amenities, ambience, and location that I experienced at the House at the Big Boot.

The hotel is an old 4 storey building with lots of charm and charisma, amazing artwork and touches from dining area to corridors and bedroom. There are no lifts so bear this in mind if travelling with children / lots of luggage or elderly companionsWe stayed in the attic room on the 04th floor (which was massive) - it could easily fit 5 or 6 people. Nice little balcony and sitting area facing Prague castle and was great place to just chill out and relax after long day exploring the sightsMy one issue - there was no curtains or window shades in the attic room so room did get quite bright - However we had our own eye-masks so this was not really an issueFacilities were clean and in excellent condition - shower and bathroom were spotless / Wi-Fi was super quick - Attic Room included a large double end / lounge area and fridge / sink and other basics. Continental breakfast with eggs cooked to order with local breads and fruits were super fresh and delicious and set us up for our two amazing days in Prague.The staff really made our stay - from checkin to checkout - as well as emails / calls before our stay.

Attic room is huge, but high angle ceiling limits the usages of some spots closer to the walls. King bed could use an extra pillow for each person but was comfortable and firm so no sore backs! Bathroom was clean and functional and came with a small kitchenette that we didn't use ( no fridge). Rear balcony was nice...quiet with a view to the castle and grounds. Wonderful architecture surrounding you. To the front was the German Embassy and 2 policemen 24/7. Whole street is embassies with a guarded entrance so you are guaranteed safety!If you are average fitness you can walk straight to the castle in 10 minutes, maybe 10 minutes to the Charles Bridge too. Plenty of places to grub and drink near the square 5 minutes away. Only transport we used was the bus-tram from airport and an Uber to the central train station. Walked everywhere else.Staff is A+++++++ helping us with everything we needed from getting train tickets to Vienna at half the price on cd train ticket site, to a list of wonderful places to eat with locals rather than tourist traps.Breakfast was plentiful with egg choices cooked to order, meats/cheeses, and cereals, breads, youghart.Only downside was that the room being in the Attic was a little warm so we had front window open at night and all it takes is one car on those cobbles to generate a racket!All in all a great choice and probably our best hotel experience of our 9 night trip throughout Eastern Europe.","October 17, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

We were offered a drink, a map was awaiting us, and all the sites and best places to eat were marked out and discussed along with some historical facts about the city and country.We were then shown to our room which was situated on the ground floor, and which had once been the Cobbler’s workshop.The room was spacious, clean and well furnished, with rich coloured wooden beams and wooden floor.Thank you to Jan, family and staff for your help, friendliness and for being so welcoming. Also for the delicious breakfasts.All attractions were within walking distance but local transport is also available if preferred.Wish we could have stayed longer to take in a few of the concerts.We will be back!!","September 26, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

Everyone from family to staff were engaging and helpful. We loved the area, away from the crazy busyness of the old town but close enough to enjoy. Room was very roomy and clean. Go don't hesitate.

1611,In love with the House of the Big Boot from the moment Jan picked us up at the airport. Our flight was late but there was still a warm greeting and we felt so welcome. Jakub had recommended a smaller room since I wanted a pretty view. It was so lovely.Daniel went over the map of the city and off we went to enjoy our first day in Prague.These folks were kind to everyone and at all times.Breakfast was terrific. I just can't say enough about this charming hotel. Found it in Rick Steve's travel book.,"August 19, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

1613,"We were very pleased with our stay at this family-owned hotel. Jakub, the son of the original owner, met us and insisted that his staff assist us with our bags. We were grateful as we counted 58 steps up the winding stairwell to the 3rd floor. We were two couples and stayed in the two-room suite with a shared bathroom. The rooms were spacious and the wooden furniture beautiful. (We were meticulous about not leaving wet towels anywhere!) Jakub gave us a thorough overview of Prague before we went exploring. Location was great; only about 10 minutes walk to the Charles bridge, but the street is somewhat of a low traffic area, so we enjoyed quiet nights. His recommendations for restaurants was helpful as well. The service from the staff made us feel like we were family. The same staff member who carried our luggage upstairs, served us breakfast the next morning. Jakub's father, Jan, cooked our eggs for the more than adequate breakfast. Our nights were very comfortable and we were glad for this find. The bonus was that at our host's prompting we made a visit to the German Embassy across the street; they had their yearly open house the day we were there; we found that this Embassy played a significant part in the re-unification of Germany in 1989, after literally thousands of East Germans sought refuge here. Our hosts were also part of this as well, providing food and accommodation for many.Oh, and the name? Apparently this would have been the house and shop of the shoemaker in days gone by.Highly recommended.","July 22, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

I arrived at 9.30 am and expected to get the normal "" your room is not ready"" but no my room was ready and I was offered breakfast immediately. I then need help on my bike and got driven to a bike repair shop and helped out. this then made it easy for me to spend time exploring the city. The hotel is on the quit side of Prague but only 10 minutes walk to the magnificent Charles Bridge and inspirational Lennon Wall.

When we inquired about a Laundromat, they offered to take care of our laundry, and it was done perfectly and for a very reasonable charge. Our rooms were lovely and spacious. I loved being in the Little Quarter and away from the crush of loud partying tourists in Old Town; yet we were an easy walk to almost everywhere we wanted to go.

1619,"Prague was the third and final leg of our 3-city European tour and Dum U Velke Boty helped make it our favorite! We were warmly welcomed by Laura who gave us an overview of Prague and Mala Strana. Over the course of our stay, we had lovely interactions with the owner (who cooked and served us breakfast on our final early morning), his sons (one of whom drove us to the airport), Laura and other staff. Our two rooms were super comfortable. Our teenage sons stayed in Room 37, while my husband and I had the room with the terrace and view of the Prague Castle. This room was was well worth 10 extra Euros per night. Reading, relaxing and having a glass of wine outside was wonderful given the very warm weather and no AC. Though very quiet, the location is walkable to all the classic tourist sights as well as those off the beaten track. Breakfast was tasty and filling: enough to last through an early dinner. We followed Laura's restaurant recommendations and liked them all. There is no doubt, when we are next in Prague, we will stay here again!","June 24, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

1620,"House at the Big Boot was recommended by a friend and I am glad I chose to stay here. It’s in a quite location opposite the German Embassy but only 15 mins walk away from the hustle and bustle of Charles Bridge. It is in the Little Quarter and I think you would agree this is a good spot not far from the castle. We had a second floor room which was lovely and big with a good sized bathroom, no air con but this is a 500 year old house and didn’t stop us from enjoying our stay. The hotel has been renovated and furnished in a traditional style and is really very nice.Breakfast was good and prepared by the owner who, along with everyone else, was very welcoming and friendly and gave us lots of useful information - thank you. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and would definitely come back should we visit Prague again. There is tea making facilities on the ground floor but the one thing that would make it even better would be to have a small kettle in the room to make a hot drink.","June 17, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

1623,"My friend and I booked the two small double rooms and were delighted with them. The very modern bathrooms - linked to the traditional bedrooms - worked extremely well. In addition we loved the garden view from our windows. Location was perfect - combining the quiet and peace of the area but within a short walk of restaurants and shops. Conveniently situated between the Castle area and Charles Bridge.Everyone who looked after us, was very helpful and pleasant but in particular we would like to say a special 'Thank you' to Laura our Receptionist. Her ability to work out the logistics of getting us to various destinations with full instructions was so helpful. On our last evening we had left it rather late to have dinner and then go on to a Jazz Club and we almost abandoned the idea. However, Laura stepped in and magically booked a table at a convenient restaurant and the jazz club - plus a taxi and within minutes we were wizzing off - and had a wonderful final evening.Just a couple of points that we believe would have enhanced our visit - (a) A tea/coffee making facility in our room - This facility was offered in the entrance lobby but we would have welcomed the opportunity to have this facility in our room in order to make it first thing in the morning.(b) I found the breakfast arrangement a bit chaotic insofar as the cooked breakfast was served to table but sometimes one was overlooked or forgotten.Apart from these two issues I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a very pleasant experience.","May 18, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

It's a quiet yet incredibly convenient location - easy walking distance to most sites and to all public transportation. Our room was spacious, lovely, comfortable & exceptionally clean. Breakfast was excellent, and they stock a fridge with water, beer, wine for guests. Most of all, the staff were incredible - welcoming, friendly, helpful - they made the stay extra enjoyable.

1628,"Loved this family run B and B! We stayed here on reccomendation of friends, so alot of their business is word of mouth. Be sure to ask for a room on an upper floor, the rooms there are bigger and a couple have a view of the castle on the back of the house. We were originally on the ground floor in a small room, but requested to change to another room. Our host graciously allowed us to trade rooms with another couple who also were switching rooms due to street noise. They are often full in season, so be sure to ask for this ahead. Breakfasts were generous and delicious. We were able to arrange with the owner a ride from the train station on arrival, and a ride to the airport when we left for a very reasonable fee. Be warned however that they take payment only in cash, Euros are accepted. Prague is a very walkable city, and the Big Boot is near the castle, and the bridge to the old city.

After some flight delays, we arrived late but the staff rebooked our transfers for us and warmly welcomed us quite late at night. As we were travelling with two children we were given a suite on the first floor which had a separate small bedroom for the children and two bathrooms. The main suite was very large, nicely furnished and overlooked the cobblestone roads and German embassy. There’s a small park about 100m away too. Breakfast was very good with breads, cereals, yogurt, cheese, fruit, cake, ham, eggs and bacon. We were also treated to delicious hot chocolates too. But the highlight of our trip were the staff. Jakub and Jan were fantastic but so were their young staff! We had luggage go missing from our airline and were lucky to have such wonderful people to help with our language barrier. We stayed at some lovely places during our trip but the hospitality of dum u velke boty made this our whole family’s favourite!

1630,"I have this thing about finding a place to stay in the place I travel that enables me to humbly experience a life like the locals. I found this house because of its impressive review by the Guardian and lucky enough, they were available. They don't need advance payment (I was quite surprised) but happy to know their level of trust :)We wanted to stay in Mala Strana to stay a bit away from the crowded Old Town Sq and could enjoy the beautiful landscape from the Prague Castle. It does require a bit of walk, but after first night we were getting used to it. The room is very pretty and huge for the price we paid and it feels like a home away from home to us both. All the staff are very attentive and basically helped us with any guide we need! That includes finding good local restaurant and even find us a ticket to a Vivaldi Concert because of course it is easier to speak with their language. We arrived early and Jan was at the top of his service, allowed us to have breakfast before check in (without add cost) and allowed us to have very early check in (10 AM) so we can change and spend the day exploring. Breakfast is fulfilling and enough to keep us full up until lunchtime and it is a very quiet hotel so I am sure couples will enjoy this!A very short walk to Prague Castle and Charles Bridge - and we provided a map to help us walking around ourselves. All in all it is a very pretty hotel and always nice to know that it is not every day they host traveler from my country (Indonesia). Will recommend this to anyone and come back here anytime soon!","January 16, 2018","29    House at the Big Boot

Nestled in a quiet street, the family owners couldn't be more charming, really. They'll helpfully point out the tram stops, the epic castle's that's 5 mins away, & the lovely walk over the nearby hill. Prague's much more interesting than having to suffer the epic tourist crap that's offered as authentic.The Big Boot House is likewise genuine, and that's an authentic recomandation.

1632,"We stayed for three nights at the House at the Big Boot (Dum U Velke Boty). What a perfect choice! The house itself is tucked in among the Embassies quite near the Castle. It's a family home that has been lovingly updated with all the modern conveniences. Each room has its own style. Our room in the front overlooked the German Embassy and was HUGE! Breakfast was substantial and varied, and we took advantage of our hosts' willingness to transport us to and from the airport as well. Just a lovely and convenient place to stay would have been wonderful, but what makes this place really special is the people. Both the family and the staff members are AMAZING! They spend a lot of time when you arrive orienting you to the city and giving you tips on how to make the most of your time there. No matter how crazy busy they are, they stop and help you with whatever you might need. What to do? Where to eat? Laundry? Transportation? Check, check, check. Emailed questions before and after the trip got fast & thorough responses, and they have gone way above and beyond to be helpful! The ride to the airport was a mini tour & we learned a bit about their experience under Communist rule. They will even do private walking tours. Beautiful place + gracious and generous hosts = Magical stay.","December 13, 2017","29    House at the Big Boot
